## Purpose of This Document

This section contains the **canonical specification** of the MicroCanvas Framework (MCF) version 2.2.

The content under `/canon` defines the **authoritative semantics, constraints, and invariants** of the framework.  
It is intended to serve as a stable reference for academic review, methodological evaluation, and controlled derivation.

This specification is **normative**.

---

## Scope

The canonical specification defines:

- Core definitions and terminology
- The epistemic stage model
- Evidence-first progression logic
- Decision thresholds and reversibility rules
- Governance, auditability, and misuse boundaries
- Failure modes and termination logic
- Versioning rules and framework boundaries

The canonical specification does **not** define:

- Operational workflows
- Prescriptive tools or templates
- Scoring or maturity models
- Implementation programs
- Certification or compliance schemes

---

## Canonical Status and Authority

All content in `/canon` is considered **authoritative** for MCF 2.2.

In case of inconsistency between this specification and any other material
(including books, articles, tools, diagnostics, or training content),
**the canonical specification prevails**.

No other section of the documentation may override, reinterpret, or extend
the semantics defined herein.

---

## Non-Operational Nature

MCF 2.2 is defined as an **epistemic framework**, not an execution methodology.

The canonical specification:

- Does not prescribe sequences of action
- Does not define required deliverables
- Does not impose workflows or phase gates
- Does not assume organizational maturity or readiness

Operationalization, tooling, and delivery models are considered **derivative layers**
and are explicitly excluded from the canonical scope.

---

## Identity Statement

MCF 2.2 is a canonical epistemic framework that defines evidence-first progression and decision integrity constraints for innovation decisions. It specifies authoritative semantics and boundaries for interpreting epistemic stages, evidence quality, and decision thresholds. The canon is normative and supersedes derivative materials. It does not prescribe workflows, deliverables, or operational methods.

---

## Epistemic Orientation

Canonical stages in MCF 2.2 represent **states of epistemic resolution**, not workflow phases.

Progression through stages is:

- Non-linear
- Evidence-driven
- Reversible under defined conditions
- Compatible with parallel activity

Any interpretation of stages as mandatory process steps is **non-canonical**.

---

## Evidence and Decision Integrity

All progression logic within MCF 2.2 is grounded in **evidence quality**, not activity completion.

The canonical specification defines:

- Evidence sufficiency thresholds
- Evidence decay and revalidation logic
- Conditions for regression or deferral
- Decision reversibility constraints

Activity without evidentiary support is considered **theatrical** and carries no epistemic weight.

---

## Misuse and Boundary Conditions

The canonical specification explicitly defines boundaries for acceptable use.

MCF 2.2 must not be represented as:

- A guarantee of innovation success
- A certification or compliance standard
- A maturity scorecard by default
- A linear delivery methodology

Use outside these boundaries constitutes **misrepresentation**.

---

## Versioning and Stability

This document defines **MCF 2.2**.

Subsequent versions may introduce:

- Clarifications
- Formal corrections
- Errata

They may not introduce new semantics without a version increment.

Canonical content is designed for **long-term stability**.

---

## Relationship to Derivative Materials

All other materials (books, tools, diagnostics, programs, extensions)
are considered **derivative interpretations** of this specification.

Derivative materials:

- Must reference canonical sections explicitly
- May not introduce conflicting semantics
- May be updated independently

The canonical specification remains the sole source of truth.

---

## Intended Audience

This document is written for:

- Researchers and academic reviewers
- Framework designers and methodologists
- Governance and audit stakeholders
- Advanced practitioners requiring epistemic clarity

It is not intended as an onboarding guide or instructional manual.

---

## Reading Guidance

Readers unfamiliar with epistemic or evidence-based frameworks
are encouraged to consult derivative explanatory materials.

Such materials are **informational only** and do not carry canonical authority.
