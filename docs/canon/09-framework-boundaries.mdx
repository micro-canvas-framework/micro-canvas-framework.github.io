## Purpose (Normative)

This section defines leadership alignment and expansion as governance boundaries for decision authority, sponsorship, escalation, and evidence responsibility in MCF 2.2 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## What this defines

Leadership alignment is the explicit alignment of decision authority with evidence responsibility and escalation ownership for a defined decision scope (Kelly, 2006).

Leadership expansion is the extension of that authority and responsibility to broader scopes without altering evidence responsibility or escalation ownership.

Scope boundaries:
- In-scope: authority assignment, sponsorship responsibility, escalation ownership, and evidence responsibility for innovation decisions.
- Out-of-scope: leadership styles, training programs, organizational charts, HR policy, operational execution guidance, KPIs or performance targets, thresholds mechanics, reversibility rules, and misuse signaling.

This boundary uses canonical terms Evidence, Evidence quality, Decision threshold, Optionality preservation, Strategic deferral, and Reversibility as defined in [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions).

Interfaces: evidence responsibilities are constrained by [Evidence Logic](/docs/canon/evidence-logic), decision authority aligns to [Decision Theory](/docs/canon/decision-theory), and governance scope aligns with the [Epistemic Model](/docs/canon/epistemic-model).

## Sources & Grounding

Governance boundary framing aligns with OECD guidance on innovation governance (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015). Epistemic grounding for evidence responsibility aligns with canonical sources on knowledge and evidence (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006).

## How to Apply

This boundary applies when interpreting whether decision authority, sponsorship, escalation ownership, and evidence responsibility are explicit for the decision scope at issue.

Leadership expansion is valid only when authority extension preserves evidence responsibility and escalation ownership across scopes.

Canonical authority is limited to the specification; derivative materials must not extend canonical semantics beyond [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions).
