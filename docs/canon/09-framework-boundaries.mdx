## Scope

This section specifies boundary conditions of applicability and canonical authority for MCF 2.2 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## What the Framework Is

MCF 2.2 defines an epistemic framework that centers evidence-first progression and decision integrity as canonical constraints (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006).

## What the Framework Is Not

MCF 2.2 is not a delivery methodology. It is not a maturity scorecard by default. It is not a certification scheme. It does not guarantee outcomes (Gilboa, 2010).

## Relationship to Adjacent Frameworks

MCF 2.2 may be used alongside other frameworks without altering their semantics. Such use does not extend or override the canonical specification.

## Authority Boundaries

Canonical authority ends at the specification; see [Versioning and Termination](./versioning-termination). Interpretations, tools, and guides beyond the canon are derivative materials and must not extend canonical semantics; see [Definitions](./definitions).

## Misrepresentation Constraints

MCF 2.2 is misrepresented when presented as a certification standard, a default scorecard, or a linear process, or when claims exceed canonical scope (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not prescribe integration methods, tooling, or comparative guidance.
