## Purpose (Normative)

This section defines boundary conditions for applicability and canonical authority for MCF 2.2 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## What this defines

MCF 2.2 defines an epistemic framework that centers evidence-first progression and decision integrity as canonical constraints (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006).

- Canonical scope is limited to the specification of epistemic constraints and governance boundaries.
- Canonical authority ends at the specification; derivative materials must not extend canonical semantics as defined in [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions).
- MCF 2.2 may be used alongside other frameworks without altering their semantics; such use does not extend or override the canonical specification.

MCF 2.2 is not a delivery methodology, a default maturity scorecard, or a certification scheme, and it does not guarantee outcomes (Gilboa, 2010).

MCF 2.2 is misrepresented when presented as a certification standard, a default scorecard, or a linear process, or when claims exceed canonical scope (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

This section does not prescribe integration methods, tooling, or comparative guidance.

## Sources & Grounding

Boundary framing and scope constraints draw on governance and measurement framing in the OECD guidance (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015). Epistemic framing aligns with canonical sources on knowledge and evidence (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006). Outcome non-guarantee constraints align with decision-theoretic grounding (Gilboa, 2010).

## How to Apply

Canonical authority applies only to the specification. Any interpretation, tool, training, or guide outside the specification is derivative and must not extend canonical semantics as defined in [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions).

Claims that rely on versioning or termination boundaries are governed by the canonical rules in [Versioning and Termination](/docs/canon/versioning-termination).
