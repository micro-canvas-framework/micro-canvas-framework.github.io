## Purpose (Normative)

This section defines leadership alignment as a governance boundary that constrains decision authority, escalation, and evidence responsibility for MCF 2.2 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## What this defines

Leadership alignment is the explicit alignment of decision authority with evidence responsibility and escalation ownership within an innovation decision context (Kelly, 2006).

- Decision authority is defined by scope of decision responsibility rather than organizational hierarchy.
- Sponsorship is the governance authority to accept or reject evidence within a defined scope of decision responsibility.
- Cross-functional authority is recognized when functional constraints affect decision validity and require explicit ownership.
- Leadership expansion is the extension of decision authority across broader scopes while preserving evidence responsibility and escalation ownership.

This section does not define leadership styles, training programs, organizational charts, reporting structures, or performance targets.

This section does not define operational execution methods, delivery practices, or instructional guidance.

Canonical terminology aligns with [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions), and evidence constraints align with [Evidence Logic](/docs/canon/evidence-logic) and [Decision Theory](/docs/canon/decision-theory).

## Sources & Grounding

Governance boundaries and authority constraints align with OECD framing on innovation governance (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015). Epistemic grounding for evidence responsibility aligns with canonical sources on knowledge and evidence (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006).

## How to Apply

Leadership alignment is satisfied only when decision authority, evidence responsibility, and escalation ownership are explicitly specified for the decision scope at issue.

Cross-functional constraints require explicit authority assignment when they affect decision validity.

Leadership expansion is valid only when authority can extend to broader scopes without altering evidence responsibility or escalation ownership.

Canonical authority is limited to the specification; derivative materials must not extend canonical semantics beyond [Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions).
