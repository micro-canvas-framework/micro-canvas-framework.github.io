## Scope

This section specifies decision thresholds, reversibility, and termination-adjacent constraints within the canonical decision logic.

## Decision Thresholds

A decision threshold is a canonical boundary defined by evidence sufficiency and quality; see [Definitions](./definitions). Decisions require evidence that meets the applicable sufficiency thresholds as defined in [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic).

## Reversibility and Irreversibility

Decisions may be reversible or effectively irreversible depending on context. Reversibility is a canonical property of a decision state, not a process step. Irreversibility increases the evidentiary burden required to justify a decision.

## Decision Integrity Constraints

Decision integrity excludes decision theater; see the [anti-theater principle](./evidence-logic). Decisions must be justified by traceable evidence and remain auditable within the governance boundaries defined elsewhere.

## Deferred Decisions and Optionality Preservation

Strategic deferral is a valid decision outcome when thresholds are not met. Optionality preservation is a canonical constraint that limits irreversible commitments until evidence supports the decision.

## Termination-Adjacent Logic

Termination is a governed outcome with explicit logic defined elsewhere; see [Versioning and Termination](./versioning-termination). Termination decisions are subject to the highest integrity constraints.

## Relationship to Stages

Decisions interact with epistemic stage states without defining stages as workflow steps; see the [Epistemic Model](./epistemic-model).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not prescribe decision-making processes, meeting structures, or governance rituals.
