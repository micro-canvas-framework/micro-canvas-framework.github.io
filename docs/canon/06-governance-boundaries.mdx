## Scope

This section specifies the canonical governance boundaries for decision integrity, evidence accountability, and permissible claims.

## Governance Boundaries

Governance boundaries constrain how decisions are justified, how evidence is interpreted, and how accountability is assigned within the canonical framework.

## Roles and Decision Rights

Canonical roles and decision rights exist as normative constraints, defining who may authorize or invalidate decisions within the governance boundary. This specification remains abstract and non-operational; see [Definitions](./definitions).

## Traceability and Auditability

Decisions and evidence must remain traceable and auditable within the governance boundary. These requirements apply to evidence logic and decision thresholds; see [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic) and [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Compliance Boundaries

Compliance claims are bounded by the canonical specification. The canon defines what can and cannot be claimed as compliant, and any claim outside those limits is non-canonical.

## Misuse Boundaries

Misuse boundaries define prohibited representations and applications of MCF, as constrained by the canonical specification and governance limits.

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not define operational governance processes, controls, or compliance programs.
