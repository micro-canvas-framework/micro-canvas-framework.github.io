## Scope

This section specifies stage mechanics as epistemic mechanics, not as process mechanics or workflow guidance.

## Parallelism

Multiple epistemic activities and states may proceed in parallel. Parallelism does not imply or require a fixed stage sequence.

## Regression

Regression is permitted when evidence decays, expires, or no longer supports the current state, or when decisions are reversed. See [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic) and [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Optionality Preservation

Optionality preservation is a canonical constraint on progression and commitments; it limits irreversible commitments until evidence supports a decision threshold as defined in [Definitions](./definitions).

## Strategic Deferral

Strategic deferral is a legitimate epistemic outcome when evidence is insufficient or risk is asymmetric; see [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Revalidation Coupling

Revalidation requirements are coupled to stage confidence and can trigger regression or deferral; see [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not define activities, deliverables, or recommended workflows.
