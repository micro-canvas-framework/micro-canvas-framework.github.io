## Scope

This section defines canonical constraints for framework versioning and termination logic boundaries (Steele, 2015).

## Versioning Rules

MCF versions are semantic versions of the framework specification, not of website or repository commits. Canonical changes require explicit version increments and may not be applied silently.

## Change Control Constraints

Canonical changes require explicit decision authority, a corresponding version increment, and a changelog entry as normative constraints (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015).

## Termination Logic

Termination is a governed outcome under canonical decision logic; see [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Reversibility and Finality

Termination decisions may be reversible or irreversible depending on context (Gilboa, 2010). Finality increases the evidentiary burden under the canonical decision constraints (Gilboa, 2010).

## Relationship to Derivative Materials

Derivative materials may evolve independently but must track and reference the applicable canonical version as defined in [Definitions](./definitions).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not define release procedures, repository workflows, or operational governance mechanics.
