## Scope

This section specifies the canonical epistemic stage model as a set of epistemic states that represent resolution of knowledge, not process steps (Steup, 2005). Terminology follows the canonical definitions in [Definitions](./definitions).

## Stage Semantics

Canonical stages are epistemic states rather than workflow phases. Transitions are non-linear and driven by evidence sufficiency as defined in the canonical evidence logic (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2019).

## Canonical Stages

- The canonical stage set is defined by the specification and listed in the canonical materials.
- Pre-Discovery is non-canonical and is reframed as capability scaffolding.
- Pre-Discovery may occur in parallel with canonical epistemic stages.

## Transition Properties

- Non-linear: stage transitions are not constrained to a fixed sequence.
- Parallelism: multiple epistemic states may progress concurrently.
- Regression: a stage may revert when evidence no longer supports the current state (Gilboa, 2010).
- Optionality preservation: irreversible commitments are deferred until evidence supports a decision threshold.
- Strategic deferral: decisions may be intentionally delayed pending required evidence.

## Non-Operational Boundary

This model does not prescribe sequences, deliverables, or required activities.

## Relationship to Evidence Logic

Evidence-driven progression is defined in the canonical evidence logic; see [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic) as the normative source.
