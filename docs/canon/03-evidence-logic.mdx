## Scope

This section specifies the evidence-first progression logic and the evidence lifecycle constraints that govern epistemic state transitions.

## Evidence-First Progression

Progression is determined by evidence sufficiency and quality, not by activity completion or procedural milestones (Kelly, 2006).

## Evidence Quality

Evidence quality is the canonical basis for decision thresholds as defined in the [Definitions](./definitions). Quality is assessed against the criteria defined by the canonical specification rather than by operational metrics or methods (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2019).

## Sufficiency and Thresholds

Decisions require evidence that meets defined sufficiency thresholds. Decision thresholds and reversibility constraints are specified in the decision logic defined elsewhere; see [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Decay, Expiration, and Revalidation

Evidence decay is the loss of evidentiary strength due to time, context change, or relevance loss. Evidence expiration denotes that evidence is no longer valid for the current decision context. Revalidation is the requirement to confirm that evidence still satisfies the applicable threshold.

## Regression and Deferral Triggers

Evidence decay or expiration can trigger regression to a prior epistemic state or strategic deferral of decisions until thresholds are met.

## Anti-Theater Constraint

Activity without evidentiary support has no epistemic weight, consistent with the [anti-theater principle](./definitions).

## Traceability and Auditability Requirements

Evidence must remain traceable and auditable within the governance boundaries defined elsewhere; see [Governance Boundaries](./governance-boundaries) and [Framework Boundaries](./framework-boundaries) (ISO/TC 176, 2016).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not prescribe instruments, research methods, or deliverables.
