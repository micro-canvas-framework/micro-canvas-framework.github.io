## Purpose and Scope

This section defines the canonical terminology used throughout MCF 2.2 (International Organization for Standardization (ISO), 2020). The terms below are the authoritative reference for interpretation and review.

## Terminology Rules

- Use the preferred term as defined here and avoid introducing synonyms.
- Do not infer operational meaning beyond the stated definition.
- Where a term is defined, related phrases inherit the same meaning unless explicitly overridden here.

**Glossary**

> **Authorship note (normative):** Terms without an external citation are **MCF-defined terms** introduced by this specification for precision and governance. Terms with external citations are aligned to established usage in the cited sources, and adapted only where explicitly stated.

- **Anti-theater principle:** A constraint that denies epistemic weight to activity that is not supported by evidence.
- **Auditability:** The property of a decision or state being reviewable against the canonical rules and traceable evidence, supported by a durable audit record. (NIST, 2015)
- **Canonical specification:** The authoritative, normative definition of MCF 2.2 semantics, constraints, and invariants.
- **Decision threshold:** A criterion that determines when available evidence justifies a state change, analogously to decision rules that compare a statistic to a threshold in formal decision/detection theory. (Chan, 2015)
- **Derivative materials:** Non-canonical works that interpret, explain, or apply the canonical specification.
- **Epistemic stage:** A labeled canonical state defined by the degree of epistemic resolution achieved (i.e., how far justified belief has been established for the decision context). (Steup, 2005)
- **Epistemic state:** The current level and integrity of knowledge regarding a specific innovation decision context. (Steup, 2005)
- **Evidence:** Documented observations or results that support or refute a claim relevant to a decision, understood epistemically as that which bears on justification. (Kelly, 2006)
- **Evidence decay:** Reduction of evidentiary validity due to time, context change, or loss of relevance.
- **Evidence expiration:** The point at which evidence is no longer considered valid for decision support.
- **Evidence quality:** The assessed reliability, relevance, and sufficiency of evidence for a defined decision threshold.
- **Governance boundary:** A canonical limit that constrains acceptable use, interpretation, and representation of MCF.
- **Misuse boundary:** A defined condition where MCF is applied or represented outside of canonical constraints.
- **Optionality preservation:** The requirement to avoid irreversible commitments until evidence supports a decision threshold.
- **Parallelism:** The allowance for multiple epistemic states or activities to progress concurrently without linear dependency.
- **Regression:** A permitted return to a prior epistemic state when evidence no longer supports the current state.
- **Revalidation:** The act of confirming that existing evidence still satisfies current decision thresholds.
- **Reversibility:** The property that a decision or state transition can be undone when evidence changes or fails.
- **Strategic deferral:** An intentional delay of a decision until evidence reaches a required threshold.
- **Termination logic:** The canonical conditions under which continuation is no longer justified.
- **Traceability:** The ability to trace the history, use, or location of an object, here applied to decisions and their supporting evidence. (ISO, 2015)
- **Versioning rules:** The constraints that govern when semantic changes require a new canonical version.
