## Purpose and scope

This section defines the canonical terminology used throughout MCF 2.2. The terms below are the authoritative reference for interpretation and review.

## Terminology rules

- Use the preferred term as defined here and avoid introducing synonyms.
- Do not infer operational meaning beyond the stated definition.
- Where a term is defined, related phrases inherit the same meaning unless explicitly overridden here.

## Glossary

**Anti-theater principle**
A constraint that denies epistemic weight to activity that is not supported by evidence.

**Auditability**
The property of a decision or state being reviewable against the canonical rules and traceable evidence.

**Canonical specification**
The authoritative, normative definition of MCF 2.2 semantics, constraints, and invariants.

**Decision threshold**
The minimum evidence quality and completeness required to justify a state change.

**Derivative materials**
Non-canonical works that interpret, explain, or apply the canonical specification.

**Epistemic stage**
A labeled canonical state defined by the degree of epistemic resolution achieved.

**Epistemic state**
The current level and integrity of knowledge regarding a specific innovation decision context.

**Evidence**
Documented observations or results that support or refute a claim relevant to a decision.

**Evidence decay**
Reduction of evidentiary validity due to time, context change, or loss of relevance.

**Evidence expiration**
The point at which evidence is no longer considered valid for decision support.

**Evidence quality**
The assessed reliability, relevance, and sufficiency of evidence for a defined decision threshold.

**Governance boundary**
A canonical limit that constrains acceptable use, interpretation, and representation of MCF.

**Misuse boundary**
A defined condition where MCF is applied or represented outside of canonical constraints.

**Optionality preservation**
The requirement to avoid irreversible commitments until evidence supports a decision threshold.

**Parallelism**
The allowance for multiple epistemic states or activities to progress concurrently without linear dependency.

**Regression**
A permitted return to a prior epistemic state when evidence no longer supports the current state.

**Revalidation**
The act of confirming that existing evidence still satisfies current decision thresholds.

**Reversibility**
The property that a decision or state transition can be undone when evidence changes or fails.

**Strategic deferral**
An intentional delay of a decision until evidence reaches a required threshold.

**Termination logic**
The canonical conditions under which continuation is no longer justified.

**Traceability**
The ability to link decisions and state transitions to their supporting evidence.

**Versioning rules**
The constraints that govern when semantic changes require a new canonical version.
