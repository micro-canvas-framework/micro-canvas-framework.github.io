## Scope

This section specifies canonical failure mode categories and boundary statements for MCF 2.2 (Steup, 2005).

## Failure Mode Taxonomy

The canonical specification recognizes failure modes across epistemic, execution, and governance domains.

## Epistemic Failure Modes

Epistemic failures are failures of evidence integrity as defined in [Definitions](./definitions), inference, or epistemic claims (Steup, 2005; Kelly, 2006). These include failures associated with evidence decay or expiration and violations of the anti-theater principle; see [Evidence Logic](./evidence-logic).

## Execution Failure Modes

Execution failures are failures in implementation behavior that do not, by themselves, change epistemic state validity. Execution activity does not substitute for evidence.

## Governance Failure Modes

Governance failures are failures of decision rights, accountability, traceability, or boundary compliance (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2015; ISO/TC 176, 2016); see [Governance Boundaries](./governance-boundaries) and [Decision Theory](./decision-theory).

## Anti-Theater Implications

Theater amplifies failure modes across epistemic, execution, and governance domains and has no epistemic weight (Kelly, 2006).

## Non-Operational Boundary

This section does not provide mitigations, controls, checklists, or operational remedies.
