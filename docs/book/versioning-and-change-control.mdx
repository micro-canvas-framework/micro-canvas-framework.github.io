This page explains how canonical versions and change control are framed,
without defining new rules.

:::note Purpose
Clarify how versioning protects the integrity of the Canon and how derivative
materials are managed over time.
:::

:::info What this explains
- Why Canon changes require explicit version increments.
- How derivative materials may evolve without altering Canon.
- How termination logic protects against misuse.
- How to interpret legacy vs current material.

## Versioning in MCF 2.2 (explanatory)
MCF versions are documentation snapshots, not release cycles. The Canon is
stable by design. Changes to Canon content require explicit decisions and a
version increment so that downstream materials can be evaluated consistently.

Book content may evolve as explanations improve, but it cannot introduce new
semantics that conflict with Canon. If a conflict appears, Canon wins.

## Change control and termination
Termination logic exists to prevent drift or misrepresentation. If a derivative
material conflicts with Canon or exceeds defined boundaries, it must be revised
or removed. This is a governance safeguard, not a content preference.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret versioning language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal rules or constraints.
- Treat legacy content as non-authoritative unless explicitly mapped to current
  Canon.
