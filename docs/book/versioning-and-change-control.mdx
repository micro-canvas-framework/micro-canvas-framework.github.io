This page explains how canonical versions and change control are framed,
without defining new rules.

<div className="mcf-contract-grid">

:::note Purpose
Clarify how versioning protects the integrity of the Canon and how derivative
materials are managed over time.

:::info What this explains
- Why Canon changes require explicit version increments.
- How derivative materials may evolve without altering Canon.
- How termination logic protects against misuse.
- How to interpret legacy vs current material.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret versioning language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal rules or constraints.
- Treat legacy content as non-authoritative unless explicitly mapped to current Canon.

## Versioning in MCF 2.2
Versioning in MCF 2.2 exists to preserve interpretability over time. A version
represents a stable semantic snapshot of the Canon, not a delivery or release
cadence.

Canonical versions change only when the meaning of constraints, stages, or
decision logic changes. This ensures that evidence and decisions made under a
given version remain interpretable and auditable later.

## Canon Stability and Explicit Increments
The Canon is stable by design. Any change to Canon content requires:
- explicit governance review
- a documented rationale
- a version increment

Silent or informal Canon changes are not permitted, because they undermine
decision traceability and downstream trust.

## Evolution of Derivative Materials
Book content and other derivative materials may evolve independently as long as
they do not introduce new semantics, constraints, or guarantees.

Improvements in clarity, examples, or pedagogy are allowed. Changes that alter
meaning are not. When conflicts arise, Canon always takes precedence.

## Legacy Material and Interpretability
Legacy material may remain available for historical or educational reasons, but
it is non-authoritative unless explicitly mapped to a current Canon version.

Readers should assume that unmapped legacy content may reflect outdated
assumptions or thresholds.

## Change Control and Termination Logic
Termination logic exists to prevent drift and misuse. If a derivative material:
- conflicts with Canon
- exceeds defined boundaries
- introduces implicit guarantees

it must be revised or removed. This is a governance safeguard, not a content
preference or editorial judgment.

## Using Versioning Defensively
Versioning should be used to:
- challenge ambiguous or outdated references
- clarify which rules applied at the time of a decision
- prevent retroactive reinterpretation of evidence

A useful versioning test is:
“Which Canon version was this decision made under, and does the interpretation
still hold?”
