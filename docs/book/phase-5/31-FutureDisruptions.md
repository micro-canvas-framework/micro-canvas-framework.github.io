Anticipating disruptions is an evidence exercise, not a prediction exercise.
This chapter explains how to interpret adaptive strategy in MCF 2.2 and how to
respond to weak signals without overreacting.

## 1. Disruptions as decision risk
Disruptions matter because they change the validity of current evidence. If the
context shifts, the decision thresholds must be reassessed. Anticipation is
therefore about monitoring signals that could invalidate prior assumptions.

## 2. Adaptive strategy signals
Adaptive strategies are justified when:
- signals indicate structural change, not short-term noise
- existing commitments are reversible
- evidence suggests current paths will degrade

## 3. Overreaction and underreaction (explanatory)
- **Overreaction:** pivoting on weak signals and losing strategic coherence.
- **Underreaction:** ignoring signals until options are gone.

The evidence-first approach seeks the middle ground: act when signals cross a
threshold that justifies change.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when external conditions threaten the validity of current
decisions. It is not a forecasting guide. It is a lens for deciding when
adaptation is required.
