- When market volatility increases.
- When long-term bets require resilience.
- When signals suggest structural change.
- Before committing to irreversible expansion.

Anticipating disruptions is an evidence exercise, not a prediction exercise.
This chapter explains how to interpret adaptive strategy in MCF 2.2 and how to
respond to weak signals without overreacting.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is where long-term commitments meet shifting environments. Disruptions
matter because they can invalidate prior evidence and move decisions past their
safe thresholds. The goal is not to predict the future, but to detect when the
evidence landscape changes enough to warrant a decision review.

Adaptive strategy preserves optionality. It creates pathways to defer, pause,
or revise commitments without breaking governance integrity.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good adaptive strategy is evidence-aligned:

- Signals are monitored for structural change, not noise.
- Decisions include explicit revalidation points.
- Reversibility is preserved until thresholds are crossed.
- Governance ownership is clear when adjustments are required.

Adaptation is a decision discipline, not a reaction cycle.

## Typical Failure Modes
Disruption handling often fails at the extremes:

- **Overreaction:** pivoting on weak signals and losing coherence.
- **Underreaction:** ignoring signals until options are gone.
- **Signal cherry-picking:** selecting evidence that confirms prior bets.
- **Delayed governance:** adapting without accountability or audit trails.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to interpret whether the issue is evidence,
execution, or governance.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that supports adaptive strategy includes:

- Tracked signals tied to explicit decision thresholds.
- Documented revalidation of assumptions as conditions shift.
- Clear criteria for pausing, deferring, or revising commitments.
- Evidence that adaptation improved decision integrity, not just speed.

If signals cannot be tied to thresholds, adaptation becomes guesswork.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Misuse occurs when adaptation is used to avoid accountability:

- Treating volatility as a reason to abandon evidence thresholds.
- Rebranding panic as agility without traceable decisions.
- Making irreversible changes without governance review.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep adaptation defensible.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when external conditions threaten the validity of current
decisions. It is not a forecasting guide. It is a lens for deciding when
adaptation is required.
