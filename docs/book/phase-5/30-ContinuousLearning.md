Continuous learning is the long-term stabilizer of innovation systems. This
chapter explains how to interpret learning as evidence quality over time, not
as training volume.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is about sustaining decision integrity after scale. Without continuous
learning, evidence decays and decisions drift. Learning keeps the organization
aligned with its own evidence, allowing reversibility when assumptions change.

For example, a platform team might revisit a deprecation decision after new
usage evidence shows unintended dependencies. The learning value is in the
decision revision, not the volume of training sessions.

Learning also preserves auditability. When a decision is revisited, learning
artifacts show why a prior commitment was justified and whether the evidence
still holds. This is what prevents silent regression to intuition-only
decisions.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good learning systems show a few consistent properties:

- Evidence is retained, not just produced.
- Decisions are revisited when evidence expires or contexts shift.
- Learning signals are linked to decision thresholds.
- Feedback loops are transparent and traceable.

This is not a training program; it is a system that keeps decisions
evidence-aligned across cycles.

Clarification: continuous learning does not mean constant change. It means the
ability to revise thresholds when evidence weakens, without assuming progress is
linear or permanent.

## Typical Failure Modes
Learning failures often appear as evidence quality failures:

- **Knowledge loss:** decisions repeat past mistakes because evidence is lost.
- **Signal stagnation:** feedback loops exist but do not change decisions.
- **Incentive mismatch:** learning is discouraged when it threatens delivery.
- **Over-correction:** reacting to weak signals and destabilizing commitments.

Misuse signal: retrospectives occur, but decision thresholds remain unchanged
even when evidence contradicts them.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to classify whether the breakdown is epistemic,
executional, or governance-related.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Learning evidence should include:

- Documented decision updates based on new evidence.
- Reduced recurrence of known failure modes.
- Observable improvement in evidence quality over time.
- Traceable changes in thresholds when conditions shift.

If learning does not change decisions, it is not functioning.
Evidence sufficiency rises as optionality declines. When reversibility is low,
learning must be stronger before a commitment is reaffirmed.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Learning can be misused as activity without decision impact:

- Treating training attendance as evidence of learning.
- Accumulating insights without revising thresholds.
- Ignoring evidence expiration and revalidation needs.

Learning maturity is non-linear. Evidence can degrade, and decisions may need
deferral or reversal even after prior progress.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to prevent symbolic learning practices.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when long-term innovation depends on retention of evidence and
organizational memory. It is not a training curriculum. It is a lens for
evaluating whether learning systems are adequate.
