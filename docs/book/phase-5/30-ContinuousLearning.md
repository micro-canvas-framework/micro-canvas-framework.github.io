Continuous learning is the long-term stabilizer of innovation systems. This
chapter explains how to interpret learning as evidence quality over time, not
as training volume.

## 1. Learning as a system property
In MCF 2.2, learning is not a one-time event. It is a feedback system that
retains evidence, improves decisions, and prevents regression. Without learning
systems, innovation resets with each cycle.

## 2. Evidence of learning
Learning shows up as:
- reduced repetition of known failures
- faster decision cycles with clearer evidence
- improved alignment between assumptions and outcomes

These are signals that the system is adapting, not just moving.

## 3. Learning vs performance (explanatory)
High performance without learning is fragile. Learning without performance is
incomplete. The goal is to sustain both by capturing evidence and applying it
to future decisions.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when long-term innovation depends on retention of evidence and
organizational memory. It is not a training curriculum. It is a lens for
evaluating whether learning systems are adequate.
