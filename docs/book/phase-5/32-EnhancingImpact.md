Impact is not a claim; it is evidence of change. This chapter explains how to
interpret impact measurement in MCF 2.2 without turning it into marketing.

## 1. Impact as evidence
Impact is meaningful when it is linked to a decision. If an impact metric cannot
change a decision, it is a narrative. Evidence-first impact connects outcomes
to thresholds that justify continued investment or revision.

## 2. Communicating impact responsibly
Communication is part of governance. Claims must match evidence quality. When
claims exceed evidence, the framework is misrepresented. This chapter helps
clarify how to avoid overstatement.

## 3. Common impact distortions (explanatory)
- **Attribution inflation:** claiming outcomes that were not caused by the work.
- **Selection bias:** highlighting only positive signals.
- **Proxy drift:** using a weak metric as a stand-in for a stronger one.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when impact claims influence strategy or stakeholder trust. It
is not a reporting template. It is a lens for deciding whether impact evidence
is strong enough to stand behind.
