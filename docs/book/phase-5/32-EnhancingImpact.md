Impact is not a claim; it is evidence of change. This chapter explains how to
interpret impact measurement in MCF 2.2 without turning it into marketing.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is where impact claims become durable. Stakeholders, partners, and
governance bodies expect evidence that outcomes are real and sustained. If
impact is overstated or weakly supported, decision integrity collapses and the
framework is misrepresented.

For example, an innovation program may claim reduced customer churn, but if the
baseline period excludes a seasonality shift, the evidence is insufficient for
decisions that lock in resources.

Impact evidence also determines whether innovation efforts should continue,
pause, or be re-scoped. Without credible impact signals, decisions become
performative rather than defensible.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good impact practice has three characteristics:

- Claims are tied to measurable outcomes with clear baselines.
- Evidence quality is stated alongside the claim.
- Communication preserves boundaries and avoids overreach.

Impact is not a metric dashboard; it is a decision input. The goal is to show
what changed, why it matters, and how confident you can be about the claim.

Clarification: impact communication is not a replacement for governance. It
must acknowledge uncertainty and reversibility rather than imply inevitability.

## Typical Failure Modes
Impact failure modes are often epistemic:

- **Attribution inflation:** crediting outcomes not caused by the work.
- **Selection bias:** reporting only favorable signals.
- **Proxy drift:** substituting weak metrics for meaningful outcomes.
- **Narrative drift:** claims grow while evidence stays constant.

Misuse signal: impact claims are updated more frequently than the evidence used
to justify them.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to interpret whether the issue is evidence,
governance, or execution.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Impact evidence should include:

- Baselines and comparison periods that make change visible.
- Methods that explain how outcomes were measured.
- Evidence of durability, not just point-in-time gains.
- Traceable links between decisions and observed impact.

If evidence cannot be reviewed, impact claims should be deferred.
Evidence sufficiency rises with irreversibility. The more permanent the
decision, the stronger the impact evidence must be.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Impact communication is often misused to justify decisions:

- Treating marketing narratives as evidence.
- Using impact claims to bypass governance review.
- Ignoring boundary conditions that limit generalization.

Impact progress is non-linear. Evidence can weaken or reverse over time, and
decisions must remain revisable as that happens.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep impact defensible.
