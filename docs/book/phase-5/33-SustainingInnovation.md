Sustaining innovation means keeping decision integrity after the initial
transformation. This chapter explains how to interpret long-term sustainability
in MCF 2.2 as a system of reinforcing practices, not a fixed state.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is where innovation either becomes a durable capability or decays into
legacy habits. Sustainability is not about maintaining momentum; it is about
maintaining decision integrity and evidence quality over time.

Sustained innovation depends on renewal. Evidence expires, contexts change, and
governance must adapt. A sustainable system can revalidate assumptions without
losing accountability.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good sustainability shows in observable properties:

- Evidence thresholds remain in active use.
- Governance continues without external pressure.
- Learning systems update assumptions as conditions shift.
- Optionality is preserved rather than locked.

Sustainability is therefore a living system, not a static outcome.

## Typical Failure Modes
Sustainability failures are often slow:

- **Institutional memory loss:** practices fade as people change roles.
- **Metric decay:** evidence signals lose relevance over time.
- **Governance drift:** decision integrity weakens as urgency declines.
- **Ritualization:** practices persist without evidential justification.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to interpret whether the breakdown is epistemic
or governance-related.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence of sustainability includes:

- Continued use of decision thresholds in review cycles.
- Documented revalidation of assumptions and outcomes.
- Stable accountability for governance decisions.
- Evidence that learning changes decisions, not just documentation.

If evidence is not refreshed, sustainability becomes symbolic.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Misuse happens when sustainability becomes compliance theater:

- Treating documentation as proof of capability.
- Ignoring evidence expiration because outcomes look stable.
- Using sustainability language to avoid necessary change.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep sustainability defensible.

## Cross-References
- Book: `/docs/book/decision-logic`, `/docs/book/failure-modes`,
  `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse`, `/docs/book/versioning-and-change-control`
- Canon: `/docs/canon/definitions`, `/docs/canon/evidence-logic`,
  `/docs/canon/decision-theory`, `/docs/canon/governance-boundaries`
- **Complacency drift:** success reduces attention to decision rigor.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when long-term resilience depends on continued evidence
discipline. It is not an operating model. It is a lens for deciding whether the
system remains viable after the transformation.
