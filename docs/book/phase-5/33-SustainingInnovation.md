Sustaining innovation means keeping decision integrity after the initial
transformation. This chapter explains how to interpret long-term sustainability
in MCF 2.2 as a system of reinforcing practices, not a fixed state.

## 1. Sustainability as renewal
Sustainability is achieved when evidence, governance, and learning continue to
function after the initial program ends. If those mechanisms degrade, the
system reverts.

## 2. Evidence of sustainability
Signals of sustained innovation may include:
- continued use of evidence thresholds in decisions
- stable governance without external pressure
- renewal of assumptions as contexts change

These signals indicate a living system, not a frozen one.

## 3. Common sustainability risks (explanatory)
- **Institutional memory loss:** practices fade as people change roles.
- **Metric decay:** evidence signals lose relevance over time.
- **Complacency drift:** success reduces attention to decision rigor.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when long-term resilience depends on continued evidence
discipline. It is not an operating model. It is a lens for deciding whether the
system remains viable after the transformation.
