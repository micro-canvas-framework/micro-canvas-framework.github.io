:::note What this chapter does
- Explains marketing, engagement, and sales as evidence-generating systems rather than promotion activities.
- Shows how signals from acquisition, activation, and conversion constrain claims about demand and value.
- Connects go-to-market actions to falsifiable assumptions about customers, channels, and willingness to pay.
- Clarifies how early sales and engagement data inform decision thresholds in Discovery and Validation.

- Does not provide a complete marketing playbook or channel checklist.
- Does not assume that traction implies product-market fit.
- Does not replace problem validation, solution testing, or business model evidence.
- Does not optimize for growth before epistemic clarity is established.

- When multiple channels appear viable and require disciplined testing.
- When early traction exists but its meaning is ambiguous.
- Before committing to scale-up, automation, or paid acquisition.
