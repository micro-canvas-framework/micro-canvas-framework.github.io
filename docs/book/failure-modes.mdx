## Failure Modes in MCF 2.2
Failure modes describe *systemic patterns* where decisions degrade because evidence, governance, or boundaries are not respected. They are not judgments about team competence; they are signals that the decision system itself is under strain.

In MCF 2.2, failure modes are diagnostic constructs: naming them early allows correction before escalation or lock-in.

## Evidence-Related Failure Modes
These occur when decisions advance without sufficient or relevant evidence.
Typical patterns include:
- treating activity or output as proof of learning
- extrapolating from weak or non-representative signals
- confirming existing beliefs rather than testing assumptions

The result is often false confidence and premature commitment.

## Governance-Related Failure Modes
Governance failure modes appear when decision rights or review mechanisms are bypassed.
Common signals include:
- unclear ownership of decisions or outcomes
- decisions made “by consensus” without accountability
- irreversible commitments made without explicit review

These failures substitute authority, urgency, or momentum for evidence-based judgment.

## Boundary Violations
Boundary-related failure modes occur when actions exceed the scope defined by the framework.
Examples include:
- treating exploratory work as validated outcomes
- deploying solutions outside approved risk or compliance constraints
- scaling before epistemic readiness is reached

Boundary violations are especially dangerous because they often look like progress until consequences emerge.

## Drift and Escalation
Many failure modes compound over time:
- small evidence gaps accumulate
- temporary governance exceptions become norms
- reversibility decreases without explicit acknowledgment

Recognizing drift early is critical. Failure modes are meant to be surfaced while correction is still low-cost.

## Using Failure Modes Diagnostically
Failure modes should be used to ask better questions, not assign blame.
A practical diagnostic stance is:
- Which evidence assumption is weakest right now?
- Which governance check was skipped or softened?
- Which boundary is being implicitly crossed?

Answering these questions often reveals the corrective action needed: pause, reframe, gather evidence, or escalate review.
