This page explains the canonical failure-mode categories at a high level
without prescribing remedies.

:::note Purpose
Clarify how failure modes emerge when evidence, governance, or boundaries are
ignored.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret failure-mode language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal definitions or boundaries.
- Treat failure modes as diagnostic signals, not blame.

- Why failure modes matter in an evidence-first framework.
- How failure modes differ from normal uncertainty.

## Failure modes (explanatory)
Failure modes are patterns where decisions are made without adequate evidence,
where governance is bypassed, or where boundaries are ignored. They do not mean
teams are failing; they mean the decision system is degrading. Naming these
patterns helps teams correct course before escalation.

Common signals include overconfidence, narrative overreach, and the appearance
of progress without measurable learning. The Canon defines the formal categories
and constraints; the Book layer helps you recognize them in context.
