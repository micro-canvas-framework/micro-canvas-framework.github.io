This page explains how to interpret the MCF 2.2 materials, what is
authoritative, and how to sequence reading when you need decisions grounded in
evidence.

:::note Purpose
Give readers a clear hierarchy of sources, so they know which pages define
norms (**Canon**) and which pages explain them (**Book**).
:::

:::info What this explains
- How the Canon and Book relate.
- How to treat evidence and decision thresholds when reading.
- How to navigate when pages appear to overlap.
:::

## Canon vs Book
- Canon is **normative**. It defines the rules, boundaries, and terms.
- Book is **explanatory**. It interprets Canon for practical use but never
  overrides it.
- If there is any conflict, **Canon wins**.

## How to read for decisions
1) Start with the Canon page that defines the term or rule you are using.
2) Read the Book chapter that applies it in context.
3) Check the "Derived from Canon" section to confirm source alignment.
4) Use evidence logic and decision thresholds to decide whether to **proceed**,
   **pause**, or **revise**.
