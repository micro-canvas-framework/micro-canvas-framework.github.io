This page explains how to interpret the MCF 2.2 materials, which documents are
authoritative, and how to sequence reading when decisions must be grounded in
evidence rather than intuition or preference.

:::note Purpose
Provide readers with a clear hierarchy of sources so they can distinguish
between **normative rules** (Canon) and **explanatory guidance** (Book), and
avoid misusing descriptive examples as prescriptive instructions.
:::

:::info What this page explains
- How the Canon and the Book relate epistemically.
- How evidence and decision thresholds should be interpreted when reading.
- How to navigate the framework when pages appear to overlap in topic.

## Canon vs Book

- **Canon** is normative.  
  It defines terms, constraints, decision logic, epistemic boundaries, and
  conditions under which actions may or may not be justified.

- **Book** is explanatory.  
  It interprets Canon concepts in applied contexts, illustrates their use, and
  highlights common pitfalls, but it never creates new rules or overrides Canon.

- In case of any ambiguity or conflict, **Canon always prevails**.

## How to read when decisions are involved

When using MCF 2.2 to support real decisions, reading order matters.

1. Start with the **Canon page** that defines the concept, rule, or constraint
   you are relying on.
2. Read the corresponding **Book chapter** to understand how that concept is
   interpreted in practice.
3. Review the **“Derived from Canon”** section to verify which Canon sources
   constrain the chapter.
4. Apply **evidence logic and decision thresholds** to determine whether the
   current state justifies proceeding, pausing, revising assumptions, or
   terminating the line of inquiry.

This sequence is intentional: explanation never substitutes for epistemic
validation.

## Derived from Canon

This orientation page is constrained by the following Canon sources:

- [Canon → Introduction](/docs/canon/_intro)
- [Canon → Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions)
- [Canon → Epistemic stage model](/docs/canon/epistemic-model)
