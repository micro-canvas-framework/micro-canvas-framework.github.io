This page explains how to interpret the MCF 2.2 materials, which documents are
authoritative, and how to sequence reading when decisions must be grounded in
evidence rather than intuition or preference.

<div className="mcf-contract-grid">

:::note Purpose
Provide readers with a clear hierarchy of sources so they can distinguish
between **normative rules** (Canon) and **explanatory guidance** (Book), and
avoid misusing descriptive examples as prescriptive instructions.
:::

:::info What this explains
- How the Canon and the Book relate epistemically.
- How evidence and decision thresholds should be interpreted when reading.
- How to navigate the framework when pages appear to overlap in topic.

## Canon vs Book
**Canon** is normative: it defines terms, constraints, decision logic, and
epistemic boundaries. "Normative" means it specifies what is permitted,
required, or disallowed when making decisions under MCF 2.2.

**Book** is explanatory: it interprets Canon concepts in applied contexts,
illustrates their use, and surfaces common pitfalls. It does not create new
rules or override Canon.

If there is any ambiguity or conflict, **Canon always prevails**.

## Reading For Decisions
Use the following decision path to avoid relying on explanation alone:

1. Locate the **Canon constraint** that governs the decision you are making.
2. Read the relevant **Book chapter** to understand how the constraint is
   interpreted in context.
3. Identify the **assumption** being advanced and the **epistemic stage** it
   claims to support.
4. Confirm the **evidence threshold** that must be met to justify movement.
5. Decide whether to **proceed**, **pause**, or **revise** based on evidence
   sufficiency.
6. Record the decision and link the supporting evidence for traceability.

This sequence is intentional: explanation does not substitute for epistemic
validation.

## How Evidence Appears In The Book
Book chapters include **minimal evidence expectations** as non-prescriptive
signals of what evidence is needed to justify decisions. These are guidance
patterns, not checklists.

Evidence quality is described at a high level in terms of relevance, validity,
recency, and triangulation, without introducing new formal criteria beyond the
Canon.

## Avoiding Misuse
Common misuse patterns include:
- treating Book chapters as step-by-step checklists
- claiming certification or guarantees from Book guidance
- skipping Canon boundaries while citing Book examples

When these occur, the framework is being misrepresented. Use the boundaries and
misuse guidance to correct course.

## When To Jump Around
The Book layer is modular. It is reasonable to jump to a chapter when an urgent
governance or decision gap must be addressed. If you jump ahead, return to
earlier chapters to backfill assumptions and evidence thresholds.
