Luis serves as Head Coach and Mentor at [Doulab](https://doulab.net),
empowering the next billion entrepreneurs to build meaningful, scalable
ventures. As Innovation Advisor at [OGTIC](https://ogtic.gob.do), he helps drive
digital transformation and public sector innovation in the Dominican Republic.

He authored [The MicroCanvas Framework](https://themicrocanvas.com), an
open-source guide that redefines how organizations create, transform, and scale
innovation. Over more than twenty years, Luis has shaped open data policies,
IT standards, cybersecurity standards, and business model innovation for the
public and private sectors. His career includes experiences as an Entrepreneur
in Residence with [Singularity University](https://su.org) and influential
roles across governments, startups, and global enterprises.

Hard-won lessons also mark Luis's journey. He learned valuable insights from
two pivotal failures **Smartlife**, a software development company that fell
short due to inexperience and a missed signal to pivot, and **INFORMATIK**,
which struggled with an unsustainable business model and overreliance on a
single customer. These experiences sharpened his focus on sustainability,
diversification, and agile decision-making, making his guidance all the more
practical and tested.

Luis brings a global perspective to innovation. Above all, he is a devoted
husband and father of three, deeply passionate about technology, faith, and
human potential. He invites you to connect, learn, and work together to shape a
future where innovation drives lasting impact and prosperity.
