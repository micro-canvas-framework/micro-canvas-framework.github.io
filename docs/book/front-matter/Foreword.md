Innovation is often treated as a moment of inspiration. The MicroCanvas
Framework treats it as a **disciplined system of decisions**. MCF 2.2 brings
that system into focus by separating what is authoritative (**Canon**) from
what is explanatory (**Book**), so readers can move with clarity rather than
ambiguity.

This book is written for leaders and teams who must build real outcomes under
real constraints. It does not promise quick wins or easy answers. Instead, it
offers a structured path through **evidence**, **governance**, and **execution**
so that innovation decisions are made with intent and defended with rigor.

If you are here to transform how your organization thinks, decides, and acts,
you are in the right place. Use this foreword as a bridge into the Book layer,
then use the Canon whenever you need the rules that define the framework.
