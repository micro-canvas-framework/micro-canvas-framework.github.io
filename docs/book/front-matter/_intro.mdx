:::note What this section is
This section contains prefatory material that frames the **Book layer** of
MCF 2.2. It is explanatory in nature and exists to orient the reader before
engaging with the phase-based chapters.

Nothing in this section defines rules, constraints, or decision thresholds.
Those remain exclusively defined by the **MCF 2.2 Canon**.

## How to use the Front Matter

The pages in this section should be read **before** engaging with the Book
chapters if you are unfamiliar with the structure, intent, or epistemic stance
of MCF 2.2.

They help you understand:
- the purpose and scope of the Book layer
- how explanation differs from norm definition
- how to navigate phases without assuming linear progression

:::tip Reading guidance
- Read the **Foreword** and **Preface** for intent, scope, and authorship context.
- Read **How to Read MCF 2.2** to understand the Canon vs Book hierarchy.
- Read **How to Use This Book** to understand phase navigation and practical
  application boundaries.
