Innovation is not rare. What is rare is a **repeatable system** that turns it
into defensible outcomes. MCF 2.2 is built for that purpose. It treats
innovation as a sequence of **evidence-backed decisions**, not a series of
isolated ideas.

The framework reflects more than two decades of applied work across startups,
enterprises, and public institutions. It also reflects the failures that shape
better judgment. The method is intentionally structured so teams can **reduce
uncertainty**, **align governance**, and **deliver results** without drifting
from first principles.

This book moves through **five phases**:

- **Pre-Discovery**: establish maturity, governance, and cultural readiness.
- **Discovery and Validation**: define problems, test assumptions, and build evidence.
- **Efficiency**: optimize processes so delivery becomes reliable.
- **Scaling**: expand with clear constraints and aligned infrastructure.
- **Continuous Improvement**: sustain learning and adaptability over time.

Use this book as an explanatory guide to the Canon. When you need rules,
boundaries, or definitions, go to the Canon. When you need interpretation,
context, and application, use this **Book layer**.

Welcome to MCF 2.2. The work begins with clarity, and clarity starts here.
