In today's fast-moving world, innovation is no longer a luxury. It is a
strategic imperative. Organizations must adapt to shifting markets, evolving
technologies, and rising expectations. Without a clear roadmap, even strong
ideas can stall. MCF 2.2 provides a practical, end-to-end system for turning
innovative concepts into sustainable, evidence-grounded outcomes.
