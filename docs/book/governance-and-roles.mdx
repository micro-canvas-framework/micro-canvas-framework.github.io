Governance is a constraint system: it protects evidence quality, clarifies decision rights, and creates accountability.
:::

Governance in MCF 2.2 (explanatory)
Governance is the set of decision rights and constraints that ensure evidence
remains the basis for progress. It does not define org charts or job titles. It
defines who can decide what, under which evidence conditions, and with
which accountability.

Roles exist to prevent ambiguity and to make responsibility explicit. When
decision rights are unclear, teams substitute opinion for evidence. Governance
reduces that risk.

:::tip How to use this page

Use it to interpret governance language in Book chapters.

Use Canon pages when you need formal boundaries and constraints.

Treat governance as decision integrity, not bureaucracy.
