Scaling is not a single decision. It is a sequence of commitments that become
harder to reverse. This chapter explains how to interpret scaling strategy in
MCF 2.2, focusing on evidence thresholds, constraints, and staged expansion.

## 1. Scaling as staged commitment
In MCF 2.2, scale is justified when evidence supports a defensible commitment.
This does not mean “grow fast,” but “grow with integrity.” Each stage of scale
should clarify what assumptions are now strong enough to support expansion.

## 2. Evidence signals for scaling
Evidence that supports scaling may include:
- consistent outcomes in pilot or validation contexts
- stable operational performance under load
- decision thresholds met for irreversibility risk

The signal must be linked to the decision. Growth for its own sake is not a
valid threshold.

## 3. Constraints shape the strategy
Scaling strategy is defined by constraints: capital limits, regulatory exposure,
capacity, or dependency risk. A defensible strategy makes these constraints
explicit and uses them to sequence expansion.

## 4. Common scaling errors (explanatory)
- **Signal substitution:** confusing demand signals with readiness signals.
- **Capacity illusion:** assuming success in one context transfers unchanged.
- **Irreversibility drift:** committing to steps that cannot be undone.

Recognizing these patterns helps prevent premature scale.

## 5. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when leadership needs evidence to approve expansion or when
growth decisions require risk clarity. It is not a growth playbook. It is a
decision lens for when scale is justified.
