Scaling is not a single decision. It is a sequence of commitments that become
harder to reverse. This chapter explains how to interpret scaling strategy in
MCF 2.2, focusing on evidence thresholds, constraints, and staged expansion.

## Why This Matters In Phase 4
Phase 4 is where decisions become less reversible. The organization is no
longer proving feasibility; it is committing to expansion. Scaling strategy
defines which commitments are justified, in what order, and under which
constraints. Without a defensible strategy, scaling converts uncertainty into
irreversible risk.

In MCF 2.2, scale is warranted when evidence meets the thresholds for
irreversibility. That means decisions must be grounded in traceable outcomes,
not ambition. A scaling strategy is therefore an evidence-backed map of which
commitments you can defend and which you must defer.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good scaling strategy has three explanatory properties:

- It is staged: each step is tied to evidence that the next commitment is safe.
- It is constrained: capital, regulatory, and governance limits are explicit.
- It is reversible where possible: optionality is preserved until thresholds are met.

Good strategy does not eliminate risk. It clarifies where risk is acceptable,
where it is bounded, and where it must trigger a pause. The result is a
sequence of defensible commitments rather than a single "go/no-go" event.

## Typical Failure Modes
Scaling often fails not because growth is impossible, but because evidence is
misread. Common failure patterns include:

- **Premature commitment:** scale decisions made before thresholds are met.
- **Constraint blindness:** regulatory or capacity limits ignored in planning.
- **Evidence overreach:** pilot evidence treated as proof of systemic readiness.
- **Irreversibility creep:** optionality lost without explicit decisions.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to diagnose whether the issue is epistemic,
executional, or governance-related.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence for scaling strategy should be decision-relevant and auditable:

- Stable outcomes across multiple contexts, not single-market success.
- Clear threshold definitions for irreversible commitments.
- Evidence that constraints are monitored and within acceptable bounds.
- Documented decision trails linking evidence to scaling approvals.

If the evidence cannot justify a commitment, the correct response is deferral,
not acceleration.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Scaling strategy is often misused as a performance target rather than a
decision framework. Boundary violations include:

- Treating growth projections as evidence.
- Locking commitments before governance review.
- Using scale to compensate for unresolved validation gaps.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep strategy aligned with Canon.

capacity, or dependency risk. A defensible strategy makes these constraints
explicit and uses them to sequence expansion.

## 4. Common scaling errors (explanatory)
- **Signal substitution:** confusing demand signals with readiness signals.
- **Capacity illusion:** assuming success in one context transfers unchanged.
- **Irreversibility drift:** committing to steps that cannot be undone.

Recognizing these patterns helps prevent premature scale.

## 5. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when leadership needs evidence to approve expansion or when
growth decisions require risk clarity. It is not a growth playbook. It is a
decision lens for when scale is justified.
