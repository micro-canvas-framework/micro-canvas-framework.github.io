:::note What this chapter does
- Defines infrastructure alignment as a scaling requirement.
- Shows how organization design supports growth.
- Connects alignment to evidence of readiness.
- Frames capacity planning as a governance decision.

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not prescribe an org chart.
- Does not replace operational execution.
- Does not guarantee performance without investment.
- Does not prescribe specific infrastructure vendors.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When systems strain under demand.
- When teams are misaligned on priorities.
- When scaling introduces new dependencies.
- Before expanding capacity commitments.

Scaling depends on whether infrastructure and organization can carry the
decisions already made. This chapter explains how to interpret alignment in
MCF 2.2 and how evidence signals readiness or constraint.

## 1. Alignment as a scaling requirement
Infrastructure and organization design are not “support” functions at scale.
They determine whether decisions can be executed reliably. Misalignment
introduces variance that weakens evidence and increases risk.

## 2. What alignment looks like (explanatory)
Alignment is visible when:
- systems can absorb growth without degradation
- roles and ownership match the decision cadence
- dependencies are tracked and governed

If these conditions are missing, scaling increases noise and reduces decision
integrity.

## 3. Evidence signals for alignment
Evidence that alignment is sufficient may include:
- stable performance under increased load
- clear escalation paths for decision conflicts
- predictable delivery outcomes across teams

These signals must be tied to explicit scale decisions.

## 4. Common misalignment patterns
- **Capacity drift:** demand rises faster than system readiness.
- **Role ambiguity:** decision rights are unclear across teams.
- **Dependency opacity:** critical integrations are unowned or undocumented.

These patterns signal a need to pause or revise the scaling plan.

## 5. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when scale depends on infrastructure or organizational change.
It is not a blueprint for org design. It is a lens for deciding when alignment
is strong enough to proceed.
