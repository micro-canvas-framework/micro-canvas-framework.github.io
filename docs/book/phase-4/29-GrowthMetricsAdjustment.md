:::tip When you should read this
- When growth signals conflict or drift.
- When scaling decisions require evidence updates.
- When performance needs continuous adjustment.

Growth metrics are evidence signals, not goals. This chapter explains how to
interpret metrics as inputs to scaling decisions and how to adjust when signals
shift.

## 1. Metrics as decision inputs
Metrics should exist because they change a decision. If a metric does not
inform a threshold, it is noise. The Book layer explains how to interpret
metrics; the Canon defines the decision logic.

## 2. Adjustment as governance
Adjustment is not failure. It is the mechanism that keeps scale aligned with
evidence. When metrics show drift, the decision is whether to pause, revise, or
re-sequence scale commitments.

## 3. Common metric traps (explanatory)
- **Vanity metrics:** high numbers without decision relevance.
- **Lag bias:** slow signals masking rapid changes.
- **Local optimization:** improving a metric that harms system outcomes.

These traps reduce decision integrity.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when growth data informs scaling decisions. It is not a KPI
catalog. It is a lens for deciding how metrics should change action.
