Growth metrics are evidence signals, not goals. This chapter explains how to
interpret metrics as inputs to scaling decisions and how to adjust when signals
shift.

## Why This Matters In Phase 4
Phase 4 requires continuous decision review. Scaling introduces new variables
that can invalidate prior evidence. Metrics provide the signals that show
whether the decision environment is still stable. Without disciplined
interpretation, metrics become noise or justification rather than evidence.

Adjustment is not a sign of failure. It is the mechanism that keeps scaling
aligned with evidence thresholds and preserves reversibility when conditions
change.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good metric practice is defined by decision relevance:

- Each metric is tied to a decision threshold.
- The metric's limitations are explicitly documented.
- Signals are monitored for variance, not just averages.
- Adjustments are logged with evidence and rationale.

Good metrics support decision integrity; they do not replace it.

## Typical Failure Modes
Common metric failures distort decisions:

- **Vanity metrics:** high numbers with no threshold relevance.
- **Lag bias:** signals arrive too late to protect reversibility.
- **Local optimization:** a metric improves while system integrity declines.
- **Confirmation bias:** metrics selected to justify a prior decision.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to interpret whether the issue is evidence,
execution, or governance.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that metrics are decision-useful includes:

- Documented thresholds and how they change decisions.
- Evidence of signal stability under scale, not just early wins.
- Clear actions taken when thresholds are breached.
- Audit trails tying adjustments to evidence, not preference.

If the evidence cannot be interpreted against a threshold, it should not drive
scaling decisions.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Metrics are often misused as targets or proxies for success:

- Using metrics to justify irreversible commitments.
- Ignoring boundary conditions that invalidate signals.
- Treating adjustment as a performance failure rather than governance.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep adjustments aligned with Canon.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when growth data informs scaling decisions. It is not a KPI
catalog. It is a lens for deciding how metrics should change action.
