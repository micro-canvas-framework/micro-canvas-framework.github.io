Strategic partnerships and ecosystem integration extend capability, reach, and
resilience. This chapter explains how to interpret partnerships in MCF 2.2 as
evidence-backed commitments, not as shortcuts to scale.

## Why This Matters In Phase 4
Partnerships often become irreversible commitments at scale. They introduce
external dependencies that shape decision integrity and evidence quality. In
Phase 4, the question is not "Can a partner help?" but "Is a partner
commitment defensible under Canon constraints?"

For example, a company might integrate a logistics partner to expand delivery
coverage. The decision is defensible only if service-level evidence and failure
boundaries can be audited across the partnership boundary.

Ecosystem integration can reduce friction, but it can also reduce optionality.
The decision must be grounded in evidence of fit, risk boundaries, and the
ability to audit outcomes across organizational seams.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good partnership strategy shows evidence of:

- Complementary capability that reduces uncertainty rather than replacing it.
- Shared decision cadence and escalation paths.
- Clear ownership of integration risk and data quality.
- Governance boundaries that preserve reversibility.

The goal is to treat partnerships as decision hypotheses, not as growth
guarantees.

Clarification: partnership evidence does not replace internal evidence. It
extends it, and may need higher thresholds when reversibility is constrained by
contractual commitments.

## Typical Failure Modes
Partnership failures often appear after commitments are made:

- **Dependency lock-in:** optionality is lost due to single-source reliance.
- **Integration drift:** mismatched timelines or quality standards.
- **Signal contamination:** external data obscures internal evidence quality.
- **Boundary confusion:** unclear governance over shared outcomes.

Misuse signal: a partner is retained despite repeated boundary violations
because exit costs are treated as sunk.

These patterns signal that the partnership decision lacks defensible evidence.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that supports a partnership decision should include:

- Consistent performance in pilot collaborations.
- Evidence that incentives align with decision thresholds.
- Explicit risk ownership for integration failures.
- Traceable data and accountability across the boundary.

If evidence is ambiguous, deferral preserves optionality.
Evidence sufficiency must scale with dependency depth. The more a partner
becomes a single point of failure, the higher the evidence bar becomes.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Misuse happens when partnerships are treated as substitutes for internal
capability or validation:

- Using a partner to bypass unresolved uncertainty.
- Treating integration progress as evidence of market fit.
- Locking dependencies before governance review.

Partnership maturity is not linear. Evidence can degrade as incentives change,
so decisions may need to pause, renegotiate, or unwind.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when scale depends on external partners or platform
integration. It is not a contracting guide. It is a lens for deciding whether
partnerships increase decision integrity.
