Strategic partnerships and ecosystem integration extend capability, reach, and
resilience. This chapter explains how to interpret partnerships in MCF 2.2 as
evidence-backed commitments, not as shortcuts to scale.

## 1. Partnerships as leverage
Partnerships are justified when external capability reduces uncertainty or
accelerates validated outcomes. A partnership is not evidence; it is a decision
that should be supported by evidence.

## 2. Evidence signals for partner fit
Evidence that supports a partnership may include:
- consistent performance in pilot collaborations
- alignment of incentives and decision cadence
- clear ownership of integration risk

These signals protect against over-reliance or misaligned dependencies.

## 3. Ecosystem integration risks (explanatory)
- **Dependency lock-in:** losing optionality due to single-source reliance.
- **Integration drift:** mismatched timelines or quality standards.
- **Governance gaps:** unclear decision authority across boundaries.

These risks should inform thresholds and sequencing.

## 4. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when scale depends on external partners or platform
integration. It is not a contracting guide. It is a lens for deciding whether
partnerships increase decision integrity.
