:::info What this chapter does
- Defines Phase 1 review as a consolidation of evidence and readiness.
- Shows how to evaluate outcomes, adjust processes, and set new baselines.
- Connects lessons learned to Phase 2 readiness decisions.
- Frames closing the loop as a governance discipline, not a formality.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not replace ongoing validation or Phase 2 planning.
- Does not guarantee readiness without evidence review.
- Does not prescribe a single review format or tooling stack.
- Does not treat retrospective summary as approval to proceed.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When Phase 1 activities have completed and need assessment.
- When leadership needs a readiness decision for Phase 2.
- When processes require adjustment before scaling.
- Before committing resources to Phase 2 execution.

Phase 1 ends with a deliberate review and adjustment cycle. This chapter frames
that closure as a governance step: evidence is consolidated, gaps are named, and
the conditions for proceeding are made explicit.

## Purpose and Scope
This chapter explains how Phase 1 is reviewed and finalized at the Book layer.
It focuses on consolidating evidence and clarifying readiness. It does not
define a formal review method or prescribe tools.

## Reviewing Phase 1 Outcomes
A Phase 1 review summarizes what was learned, what remains uncertain, and which
assumptions were clarified. Evidence should be consolidated across culture,
governance, and early execution signals so the organization can make a clear
proceed-or-pause decision.

Phase 1 closeout relies on qualitative decision thresholds. The question is not
how much activity occurred, but whether evidence is sufficient to justify a
Phase 2 commitment, whether uncertainties remain material, and whether the
conditions for proceed, defer, or stop are understood.

## Adjusting the Foundation
Adjustments are about correcting the foundation before Phase 2 begins. This can
include refining governance clarity, tightening decision ownership, or
recalibrating how evidence is gathered. The goal is not to optimize but to
remove friction that would distort later decisions.

Reversibility and optionality matter at exit. Leaders should distinguish
decisions that are hard to unwind from those that can be re-tested with low
regret. When reversibility is low and evidence is thin, preserving optionality
or deferring commitment is often a more defensible outcome than forcing a move
into Phase 2.

## Finalizing Phase 1 and Handoff to Phase 2
Finalizing Phase 1 means documenting what changed, what remains unresolved, and
what conditions must hold for Phase 2 work to be interpretable. The next chapter
introduces opportunity discovery and customer analysis as the entry into Phase
2.

**Misuse and Failure Signals (Descriptive)**  
Signals that the Phase 1 closeout decision is weak include:
- advancing to Phase 2 without sufficient evidence
- re-running discovery to avoid a decision
- treating Phase 1 outputs as guarantees
- skipping explicit decision ownership at closeout

**Auditable Artifacts for Phase 1 Finalization**  
Auditable artifacts may include:
- a Phase 1 decision record (proceed/defer/stop + rationale)
- an evidence summary linked to those decisions
- an explicit statement of remaining unknowns
- leadership sign-off or sponsorship record tied to evidence

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. If a future diagram is added, it must avoid
maturity ladders and show the review/adjust cycle as a non-linear decision
sequence, not a checklist.
