## What this section is
This section contains explanatory chapters that are being refactored into the MCF 2.2 Book layer. It is derived from the MCF 2.2 Canon and does not override canonical definitions.

## How to read these chapters
- Use them as interpretive guidance, not as operational templates.
- Prefer the Canon for definitions, invariants, and constraints.
- Treat examples and framing as illustrative unless explicitly marked as canonical.
