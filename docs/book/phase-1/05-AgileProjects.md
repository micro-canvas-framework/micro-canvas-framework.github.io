:::info What this chapter does
- Defines agile execution as the delivery mechanism for innovation work.
- Shows how sprints, roles, and cadence create decision-ready progress.
- Connects iterative delivery to evidence gathering and adjustment.
- Frames agile execution as a bridge from ideas to validated outcomes.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not prescribe a single agile methodology.
- Does not replace product strategy or portfolio governance.
- Does not guarantee delivery without discipline and resourcing.
- Does not provide tooling-specific setup instructions.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When teams struggle to turn ideas into deliverables.
- When cadence, roles, or process clarity are missing.
- When you need a repeatable execution rhythm for innovation.
- Before running pilots or validation work at scale.

## Agile Projects (Explanatory)
Agile projects are an execution context where evidence is generated through
short cycles of work and decision review. In MCF 2.2, agile is valuable when it
reduces epistemic uncertainty and keeps decisions reversible while evidence is
still weak.

## What Agile Projects Are (and Are Not)
Agile projects are a decision-support mechanism under uncertainty. They are not
a delivery methodology, certification, or a guarantee of speed. Agile does not
replace governance; it provides a structure for evidence updates and decision
thresholds.

## Agile as an Evidence-Generating System
Agile cycles are useful when they produce decision-relevant evidence. Activity
is not learning; delivery is not decision quality. Iterations that do not
change a decision posture are signals of insufficient evidence rather than
progress.

Agile is an execution context for reducing decision risk, not a rule set. It
helps determine when evidence is sufficient to proceed and when deferral is
more defensible.

## Decision Thresholds in Agile Contexts
Agile supports threshold-based decisions by keeping optionality high when
reversibility is strong. As reversibility declines, thresholds rise and evidence
must be stronger before commitments can advance.

Example: In early-stage exploration, a team may proceed after a falsifiable
claim is tested and a single measured signal is logged. Later-stage execution
may require repeated evidence, an explicit threshold statement, and a reversal
trigger because the cost of error is higher.

Regression is expected; iteration is not linear progression. Timeboxed
experiments are most useful when optionality is preserved and decisions can be
reversed without disproportionate cost.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals indicate agile activity that does not improve decision integrity:

- Agile theater: ceremonies without decision change.
- Proxy metrics replacing evidence (e.g., velocity as proof).
- Mandated agility without decision rights or thresholds.
- Treating agile as a cultural value instead of a constraint system.
- Delivery momentum used to bypass reversibility analysis.
- Experimentation without explicit decision thresholds.
- “Everything is urgent” collapsing deferral discipline.

## Auditable Artifacts (Examples, Not Requirements)
Artifacts that can be inspected for evidence quality include:

- Decision log entries that state thresholds and outcomes.
- Experiment briefs with results snapshots tied to a claim.
- WIP limits or queue discipline evidence that protects optionality.
- Retrospective outcomes that change constraints, not just sentiment.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must be non-linear, show
regression and reversibility, avoid funnels, ladders, or maturity curves, and be
explicitly labeled explanatory and non-normative.
If a figure is added later, it must explicitly show non-linearity, regression,
and decision-threshold escalation.

## How This Chapter Connects Forward
Later phases depend on whether agile work changes decisions under evidence
constraints. This chapter frames agile as evidence-first execution that must
stay aligned with thresholds, optionality, and reversibility.
