## Purpose and Scope
This chapter explains the Innovation Governance Framework (IGF) as a
decision-support and coordination construct. It clarifies how an IGF helps
reduce decision risk, align evidence thresholds, and preserve optionality as
uncertainty changes.

An IGF is not an org chart, not a steering committee, not a fixed operating
model, and not ownership of innovation. It exists to make decision integrity
visible and to coordinate how evidence is interpreted across roles.

## What This Chapter Does / Does Not Do
This chapter defines what an IGF is intended to coordinate and what it is not
intended to control. It does not prescribe a committee structure, role matrix,
or operating cadence. It does not claim authority for governance beyond
decision risk reduction.

## Evidence Expectations
An IGF is functioning when evidence is traceable to decisions and thresholds
are explicit. Evidence should show:

- Which decisions require evidence and who owns those decisions.
- What thresholds govern advancement, pause, or termination.
- Where reversibility is limited and optionality must be protected.
- How evidence changes the decision posture, not just the meeting cadence.

Formal creation without decision artifacts does not count as evidence.

Decision rights act as constraints on who can move a decision across a
threshold, not as authority to override evidence. Evidence is insufficient when
it cannot justify the threshold change or when reversibility has not been
explicitly considered.

Auditable artifacts should include:
- Decision log entry (what decision, when, by whom).
- Evidence references (what was checked, and against which claim).
- Threshold statement (why evidence is sufficient or insufficient).
- Reversal trigger (what would change the decision).

## Core Concepts (Interpretive, Non-Prescriptive)
The IGF coordinates decision integrity across epistemic stages. It adapts by
stage because uncertainty and evidence sufficiency change over time. Roles exist
to reduce decision risk, not to accumulate authority.

Key ideas include:

- **Decision Support:** IGF ensures decisions are made with the evidence needed
  at the current threshold, not with opinions or hierarchy alone.
- **Coordination:** IGF aligns roles so evidence is evaluated consistently
  across teams and phases.
- **Stage Sensitivity:** IGF structures change as epistemic stages shift;
  uncertainty in Phase 1 requires different thresholds than Phase 4.
- **Optionality Preservation:** IGF keeps decisions reversible when evidence is
  weak and constrains commitments when reversibility is low.

An IGF is expected to evolve as epistemic stages change; backtracking and
restructuring are normal when evidence weakens or uncertainty increases.

Example: An early-stage opportunity may require a falsifiable claim, a single
measured signal, and a decision log entry before moving to a pilot. A later
scale decision may require replicated evidence, explicit threshold approval,
and a documented reversal trigger because reversibility is lower and optionality
is constrained.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals indicate governance that looks active but does not improve
decision integrity:

- IGF treated as a permanent committee rather than a decision-support construct.
- Role proliferation without clearer decision rights or thresholds.
- Meetings without evidence artifacts, decisions, or explicit outcomes.
- IGF frozen across phases despite changing uncertainty and evidence sufficiency.
- Progress theater: activity without learning or decision impact.
- Narrative lock-in: commitments made without reversibility analysis.
- Boundary breach: IGF presented as certification or guarantee.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is required in Pass 2. If a future visual is added, it should resolve
ambiguity about how thresholds and roles shift by epistemic stage, and it must
avoid linear ladders by reinforcing non-linearity, regression, and optionality.
