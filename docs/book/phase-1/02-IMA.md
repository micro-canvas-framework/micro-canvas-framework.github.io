:::info What this chapter does
- Defines assessment as evidence visibility and decision readiness.
- Clarifies how assessment improves threshold awareness.
- Connects assessment outputs to governance alignment and optionality.
- Frames assessment as an evidence-first baseline, not a score.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not provide a scoring model, certification, or benchmark.
- Does not provide a finished tool or automated survey.
- Does not replace leadership judgment or strategy setting.
- Does not guarantee maturity gains without execution.
- Does not prescribe a single cadence for reassessment.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When establishing evidence visibility for innovation decisions.
- When leadership needs decision readiness signals.
- When governance thresholds are unclear or inconsistent.
- Before investing in transformation or process changes.

Assessing innovation maturity is about making evidence visible, not assigning a
score. This chapter reframes assessment as a way to surface decision readiness,
threshold awareness, and the limits of current evidence.

## Why This Matters In Phase 1
Phase 1 is about orientation. An assessment clarifies what evidence exists,
where it is weak, and which decisions cannot yet be justified. This reduces
false confidence and protects optionality before commitments become harder to
reverse.

Assessment is not benchmarking. High activity without evidence discipline is a
lower maturity signal because decision integrity degrades and thresholds become
unclear.

## What "Good" Looks Like (Explanatory)
An evidence-first assessment emphasizes decision readiness over scorecards. It
typically shows:

- Clear visibility into where evidence is strong, weak, or missing.
- Thresholds that define when a decision is defensible or should be deferred.
- Explicit links between evidence gaps and governance attention.
- Recognition of reversibility constraints in critical decisions.

## Typical Failure Modes
Assessment failures usually stem from treating it as evaluation rather than
evidence visibility:

- **Scoring drift:** converting evidence into rankings that hide uncertainty.
- **Benchmark fixation:** comparing to external targets instead of local thresholds.
- **Tool substitution:** adopting surveys or dashboards without decision impact.
- **Governance bypass:** documenting gaps without ownership or follow-through.

Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to interpret whether the issue is epistemic,
executional, or governance-related.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Assessment evidence should clarify decision readiness:

- Documented evidence sources tied to specific decisions.
- Thresholds that show when evidence is sufficient or insufficient.
- Explicit notes on reversibility and optionality for key commitments.
- Clear ownership for evidence gaps and follow-up decisions.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Boundary violations appear when assessment becomes a proxy for certainty:

- Treating assessment results as certification or compliance.
- Using scores to justify irreversible commitments.
- Treating evidence absence as a minor gap instead of a decision constraint.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep assessment aligned with Canon.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is introduced in Pass 1. This chapter relies on text-only framing to
avoid ladder or scoring interpretations.
