The polygon form symbolizes performance levels, helping organizations identify strengths and gaps. It reflects the diagnostic clarity central to the MicroCanvas&reg; Framework's assessment approach.*

You need to know where you stand before setting your innovation strategy. This chapter provides a practical guide to assessing your organization's innovation maturity level using a structured, weighted scoring system. By following these steps, you'll gain clarity on your strengths and pinpoint the areas that need improvement, ensuring you build a robust foundation for change.

## Why Assess Innovation Maturity?

Assessing innovation maturity means taking a clear, honest look at how well your organization embeds innovation into its culture, processes, and strategy. When you know your current state, you can:

- **Identify Key Gaps:**  
  Recognize where your processes or mindset need reinforcement.

- **Prioritize Initiatives:**  
  Focus your efforts on the areas that promise the most impact.

- **Establish a Baseline:**  
  Measure your progress over time and set realistic targets for improvement.

- **Guide Decision-Making:**  
  Use concrete data to steer your innovation strategy and avoid costly missteps.

Taking this step now helps you avoid the hidden costs of inaction and paves the way for a successful transformation.

## The Assessment Method: A Step-by-Step Guide

### **Total Points**: 100

### **Category Explanation**:
- **Essential**: These questions are **core** to the organization's innovation maturity and directly impact its ability to innovate.
- **Important**: These questions are **significant**, providing key insights into the organization's innovation capabilities.
- **Supportive**: These questions are **valuable**, but **not crucial** for the immediate maturity assessment.

### Step 3: Calculate the Weighted Maturity Score

Use the following formula to determine your overall innovation maturity score:

> #### Final Score =
>
> (*Pre-Discovery Score x 0.10**) + (*Discovery Score x 0.20*) + (*Validation Score x 0.25) + (*Efficiency Score x 0.25*) + (*Scaling Score x 0.20*) 


This calculation gives you a percentage score that reflects your organization's innovation maturity level.

### Step 4: Assign the Organization's Innovation Maturity Level

Based on your final score, assign your organization to one of the following maturity levels:

- **90 - 100**: High performance - Exceptional innovation experience and alignment.

- **75 - 89**: Evolving - Strong, but with areas for improvement.

- **60 - 74**: Emerging - Functional baseline; strategic gaps present.

- **45 - 59**: Foundational - Development needed; many areas of improvement.

- **Less than 45**: Nascent - Early maturity or systemic issues.

### Step 5: Develop an Innovation Roadmap

Based on your maturity level, create an action plan that addresses your specific gaps:

- **Nascent**:  
  Conduct a full maturity analysis and allocate resources to kickstart innovation.

- **Foundational**:  
  Define structured processes, set clear OKRs, and test early hypotheses.

- **Emerging**:  
  Strengthen business model validation and optimize the user experience.

- **Evolving**:  
  Focus on operational efficiency, legal compliance, and financial scaling.

- **High performance**:  
  Implement continuous innovation mechanisms and prepare for future disruptions.

This roadmap provides a clear direction for improving innovation capabilities and tracking progress.

### Step 6: Repeat the Assessment Periodically

Innovation is a journey, not a destination. Reassess your organization's innovation maturity every 6 to 12 months to:

- **Monitor Progress:**  
  Compare your scores over time and identify growth areas.

- **Adjust Strategies:**  
  Refine your approach based on new data and evolving challenges.

- **Celebrate Milestones:**  
  Recognize improvements to reinforce an innovation culture and maintain momentum.

## Final Thoughts

Your innovation maturity assessment lays the foundation for transformation. Following this structured, weighted scoring system gives you a clear, data-driven understanding of where your organization stands and what steps to take next. Use this assessment as a call to action to drive meaningful change and unlock the full potential of your innovation efforts.

Now that you have a complete picture of your current state, you can confidently build a robust innovation system that continuously evolves and creates lasting impact.
