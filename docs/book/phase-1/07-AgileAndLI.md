:::info What this chapter does
- Defines training as the capability-building layer for agile and lean practice.
- Shows how curriculum, cadence, and coaching create repeatable execution skills.
- Connects training outcomes to evidence of adoption and performance.
- Frames training as a prerequisite for sustained innovation delivery.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not replace organizational change management.
- Does not guarantee adoption without leadership reinforcement.
- Does not prescribe a single training format or vendor.
- Does not provide certified accreditation guidance.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When teams lack shared agile and lean fundamentals.
- When execution quality varies across departments.
- When onboarding new teams into innovation work.
- Before scaling pilot work or governance practices.

## Training in Agile and Lean Innovation (Explanatory)
Training is a capability-enabling layer, not a certification path. In MCF 2.2
it matters when it changes decision behavior under evidence constraints and
reduces ambiguity in how teams interpret signals.

## What Training Is (and Is Not)
Training is an input to decision quality, not a guarantee of execution. It is
not a compliance program, a badge, or a substitute for governance. It should be
judged by observable changes in how evidence is gathered, interpreted, and used
to move decisions across thresholds.

## Training as Evidence-First Capability Enabling
Agile and lean training is useful when it improves evidence discipline. The
point is not to complete modules but to reduce epistemic uncertainty and make
reversibility easier when evidence is weak. Training is therefore evaluated by
what decisions it enables, not by attendance or completion.

## Decision Thresholds in Training Contexts
Training is sufficient when teams can show how evidence changes decision
thresholds and optionality. Lower-regret decisions can proceed with lighter
evidence; higher-regret commitments require stronger evidence and explicit
reversal triggers. If training does not affect those thresholds, it is not
functioning as a decision-quality enabler.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals indicate training activity that does not improve decision
integrity:

- Training theater: courses completed without decision behavior change.
- Certificates treated as proof of capability.
- Activity volume presented as progress without evidence updates.
- Prescriptive frameworks enforced without decision rights or thresholds.
- Tool adoption without observable learning or reversibility handling.

## Auditable Artifacts (Examples, Not Requirements)
Artifacts that can be inspected for evidence of capability change include:

- Decision logs showing threshold changes after training.
- Evidence notes linking training outcomes to decisions.
- Retrospective outcomes that adjust constraints or reversal triggers.
- Review outcomes that confirm, defer, or reverse decisions.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must be non-linear, avoid
maturity ladders, show regression and reversibility, and be explicitly labeled
explanatory and non-normative.

## How This Chapter Connects Forward
Later phases depend on whether training improves decision quality under
uncertainty. This chapter frames training as an evidence-first capability that
supports thresholds, optionality preservation, and reversibility rather than
compliance.
