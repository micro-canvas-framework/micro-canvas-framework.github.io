:::info What this chapter does
- Defines culture and mindset as the enablers of sustained innovation practice.
- Shows how leadership behaviors and incentives shape innovation habits.
- Connects culture change to evidence-driven learning and adaptation.
- Frames cultural work as a prerequisite for executing later phases.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not provide a full change-management playbook.

:::tip When you should read this
- When innovation efforts stall due to resistance or fear of change.
- When teams need shared behaviors and language to support experimentation.
- When leadership wants to reinforce adaptive, learning-oriented culture.
- Before scaling innovation practices across departments.

## What This Chapter Explains
This chapter explains culture and mindset as observable decision behavior under
constraints. It focuses on how evidence is interpreted, how thresholds are
applied, and how optionality is preserved when uncertainty is high.

## What Culture Means in an Innovation Context
Culture is the pattern of decision behavior that repeats under uncertainty. It
shows up in how teams respond to evidence, how reversibility is treated, and
which decisions are permitted to advance across thresholds. Culture is not
values posters, slogans, or workshop attendance; it is what decision records
show when evidence conflicts with momentum.

## Mindset as Decision Behavior (Not Attitude)
Mindset is visible in how decisions are framed, challenged, and revised. It is
not a personality trait or a training completion metric. A learning-oriented
mindset appears when teams treat disconfirming evidence as a reason to adjust
thresholds, defer commitments, or reverse decisions.

## Evidence of Cultural Readiness
Cultural readiness is evidenced by decision artifacts, not declarations. Signals
include:

- Decisions that cite evidence thresholds and explain reversibility.
- Explicit use of decision logs when evidence changes.
- Visible protection of optionality when evidence is weak.
- Governance behavior that values learning over narrative certainty.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals indicate cultural claims that are not supported by decision
behavior:

- Culture described through slogans while decision thresholds are absent.
- Mindset framed as training completion rather than evidence response.
- Decisions advanced despite insufficient evidence or unclear reversibility.
- Leadership messaging that overrides governance boundaries.

## Relationship to Governance and Assessment
Culture does not replace governance. Governance defines decision rights and
thresholds; culture determines whether those constraints are followed when
pressure increases. Assessment should surface whether cultural behavior aligns
with evidence logic, not whether people endorse a stated set of values.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must avoid linear
progression, avoid maturity ladders, represent decision behavior under
constraints, and be explicitly non-normative.

## Summary and Phase Positioning
Phase 1 is about orientation and constraint-setting, not execution. Culture and
mindset matter here because they shape how evidence is treated before decisions
harden. Non-linearity is expected: decision behavior can improve or regress as
uncertainty changes, and governance boundaries remain the reference point.
