## What This Chapter Explains
This chapter explains culture and mindset as observable decision behavior under
constraints. It focuses on how evidence is interpreted, how thresholds are
applied, and how optionality is preserved when uncertainty is high.

Culture and mindset are decision-system properties, not training outcomes. They
show up in what decisions are permitted, deferred, or reversed as evidence
changes. Evidence gates apply to culture claims like any other claim.

## What Culture Means in an Innovation Context
Culture is the pattern of decision behavior that repeats under uncertainty. It
shows up in how teams respond to evidence, how reversibility is treated, and
which decisions are permitted to advance across thresholds. Culture is not
values posters, slogans, or workshop attendance; it is what decision records
show when evidence conflicts with momentum.

Decision integrity under uncertainty depends on culture. Culture shapes which
evidence is accepted or rejected and when escalation is allowed. As reversibility
declines, thresholds rise, and cultural behavior determines whether those
constraints hold.

## Mindset as Decision Behavior (Not Attitude)
Mindset is visible in how decisions are framed, challenged, and revised. It is
not a personality trait or a training completion metric. A learning-oriented
mindset appears when teams treat disconfirming evidence as a reason to adjust
thresholds, defer commitments, or reverse decisions.

Example: A team states “we are innovative,” yet repeatedly escalates a launch
decision without evidence that a customer claim is falsifiable. If the team can
point to a tested claim, a measured signal, and a documented decision threshold
for delaying or reversing, the mindset is observable; if not, the narrative is
unsupported.

## Evidence of Cultural Readiness
Cultural readiness is evidenced by decision artifacts, not declarations. Signals
include:

- Decisions that cite evidence thresholds and explain reversibility.
- Explicit use of decision logs when evidence changes.
- Visible protection of optionality when evidence is weak.
- Governance behavior that values learning over narrative certainty.

Evidence Sufficiency by Decision Type:
- Low-regret or reversible decisions can proceed with lower evidence thresholds.
- High-regret or irreversible decisions require stronger evidence and explicit
  reversibility analysis.

Insufficiency signals include:
- Decisions advancing without stated thresholds.
- Evidence that cannot be traced to a specific claim.
- Optionality reduced without a decision record.
- Reversibility treated as irrelevant or assumed.

Auditable artifacts should include:
- Decision log entries (what decision, when, by whom).
- Hypothesis or claim notes linked to evidence.
- Review outcomes that state why evidence was sufficient.
- Post-mortems when decisions are reversed or deferred.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals indicate cultural claims that are not supported by decision
behavior:

- Culture described through slogans while decision thresholds are absent.
- Mindset framed as training completion rather than evidence response.
- Decisions advanced despite insufficient evidence or unclear reversibility.
- Leadership messaging that overrides governance boundaries.
- Workshop or communication theater without decision artifacts.
- Proxy-metric overreach (e.g., idea counts) treated as evidence.
- “Mandated mindset” language used as compliance framing.
- Selective evidence used to harden narratives.

## Relationship to Governance and Assessment
Culture does not replace governance. Governance defines decision rights and
thresholds; culture determines whether those constraints are followed when
pressure increases. Assessment should surface whether cultural behavior aligns
with evidence logic, not whether people endorse a stated set of values.

Governance constrains decisions; culture influences whether constraints are
complied with or bypassed. Assessment remains sense-making, not certification.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must avoid linear
progression, avoid maturity ladders, represent decision behavior under
constraints, and be explicitly non-normative.
Any future figure must also explicitly show non-linearity and regression.

## Summary and Phase Positioning
Phase 1 is about orientation and constraint-setting, not execution. Culture and
mindset matter here because they shape how evidence is treated before decisions
harden. Non-linearity is expected: decision behavior can improve or regress as
uncertainty changes, and governance boundaries remain the reference point.

Later phases depend on decision behavior and evidence discipline, not rhetoric.
This chapter stays descriptive and non-prescriptive by design.
