:::info What this chapter does
- Defines OKRs as the alignment mechanism for innovation strategy.
- Shows how objectives and key results translate vision into measurable action.
- Connects OKR progress to evidence review and decision thresholds.
- Frames KPIs as operational signals that validate OKR outcomes.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not provide organization-specific OKRs.
- Does not replace governance or portfolio prioritization.
- Does not guarantee outcomes without execution discipline.
- Does not prescribe a single KPI dashboard or tooling stack.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When strategic objectives need measurable outcomes.
- When teams are misaligned on priorities or success criteria.
- When leadership needs evidence of progress across initiatives.
- Before scaling or investing in larger innovation bets.

## OKRs and KPIs (Explanatory)
OKRs and KPIs are used here as decision alignment signals, not performance
scorecards. In MCF 2.2 they clarify what evidence is needed to justify
continuing, deferring, or reversing innovation decisions.

## What OKRs and KPIs Are (and Are Not)
OKRs and KPIs are interpretive instruments for decision thresholds. They are
not compliance targets, maturity scores, or guarantees of progress. They do not
replace governance; they make evidence conditions visible.

## OKRs and KPIs as Decision Alignment
When used well, OKRs clarify which decisions require evidence and how outcomes
map to those decisions. KPIs are signals that inform whether thresholds are met
or still uncertain. Alignment means decision owners can explain why a threshold
was sufficient, not just that a metric moved.

Example: An OKR claim to "increase retention" requires evidence that a retention
signal crosses a defined threshold before scaling an initiative. The evidence
needed to start a pilot is lower than the evidence needed to scale or to stop
and defer, because reversibility declines as commitments harden.

Evidence to stop or defer should be explicit. When thresholds are not met,
strategic deferral preserves optionality instead of forcing progress.

## Decision Thresholds and Evidence Sufficiency
Evidence sufficiency depends on reversibility and optionality. Lower-regret
decisions can proceed on lighter evidence; higher-regret commitments require
stronger signals and explicit reversal triggers. OKRs and KPIs help state those
conditions without treating measurement as proof.

Strategic deferral is a valid outcome. If evidence is insufficient, the
threshold is not met and optionality should be preserved until stronger signals
appear.

KPI hygiene matters. A KPI is not evidence by default; it becomes evidence only
when validity conditions are defined.

Proxy risk signals include:
- KPI movement that contradicts observed outcomes.
- A metric that trends while the underlying claim is untested.
- KPI shifts that do not change any decision posture.

Gaming risk signals include:
- Improvements that appear only after target changes.
- Discontinuities that are not explained by evidence updates.
- Metrics optimized without documented governance review.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals show when OKRs or KPIs are used as proxies for certainty:

- Metrics treated as proof of success without decision thresholds.
- OKRs used as compliance checklists rather than evidence alignment.
- KPI movement used to justify irreversible commitments.
- Targets optimized while evidence quality remains weak.
- OKRs treated as performance theater with no learning.
- Output OKRs substituting for outcome evidence.
- Targets set without an evidence plan.
- Conflicting metrics ignored with no escalation or decision rights.

Auditable artifacts (examples only) include:
- OKR evidence plan (what will be observed, when, by whom).
- Decision log entries referencing the OKR and threshold.
- Metric definition notes with validity conditions and known failure modes.
- Review outcomes that confirm, challenge, or reverse decisions.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must be non-linear, avoid
maturity ladders, show regression and reversibility, and be explicitly labeled
explanatory and non-normative. Any future figure must also show threshold
escalation as reversibility declines.

## How This Chapter Connects Forward
Later phases depend on whether OKRs and KPIs improve decision integrity rather
than metric throughput. This chapter positions them as evidence alignment tools
that stay subordinate to thresholds, optionality preservation, and reversibility.
