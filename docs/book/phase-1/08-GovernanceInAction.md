:::info What this chapter does
- Defines pilots as the execution testbed for governance decisions.
- Shows how iterative cycles turn governance into measurable outcomes.
- Connects pilot feedback to evidence updates and decision thresholds.
- Frames pilots as a controlled step before broader scaling.
:::

:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not prescribe a single pilot template or sprint cadence.
- Does not replace strategic prioritization or portfolio governance.
- Does not guarantee pilot success without resourcing and buy-in.
- Does not treat iteration as a substitute for validation.
:::

:::tip When you should read this
- When governance decisions need real-world execution tests.
- When teams need a structured pilot process to reduce risk.
- When early outcomes must inform scaling decisions.
- Before expanding innovation initiatives across the organization.

## Governance in Action: From Rules to Decisions
Governance in action is how decision integrity is maintained during live work.
It is a set of constraints on decisions under uncertainty, not an org chart,
committee, or bureaucracy. In practice, governance is visible when decision
rights and evidence conditions are applied consistently to real choices.

## Pilots as Evidence-Generating Instruments
Pilots are bounded instruments for generating evidence, not prototypes meant to
justify pre-decided scale. A pilot is considered “in action” when thresholds are
explicit and evidence is tied to a decision boundary.

Valid pilot outcomes include: continue, modify, pause, rollback, or terminate.
Each outcome is acceptable if it follows from evidence sufficiency or
insufficiency.

Those outcomes are tied to threshold logic: as decisions become less reversible,
evidence quality requirements increase, and optionality preservation becomes
more valuable. A pilot can pause, rollback, or terminate when evidence is
insufficient for a higher-irreversibility decision, without implying failure or
loss of progress.

Example (bounded, non-linear): A team proposes a claim that a new onboarding
flow reduces activation friction. The pilot tests a small cohort with explicit
thresholds and a rollback path. Evidence shows mixed results and unclear causal
signals, so the decision is to pause and revert while updating the claim and
evidence plan. Later, a revised pilot produces stronger signals, enabling a
different threshold decision without assuming linear progress.

## Iteration Without Loss of Decision Integrity
Iteration is useful when it updates evidence and changes decision posture.
Iteration without evidence change is activity, not learning. Optionality is
preserved early, and reversibility narrows as evidence strengthens. Regression
or rollback is expected when evidence undermines prior assumptions.

Auditable artifacts often include:

- Decision log entry (what/why/who/when)
- Pilot charter (claim, scope, stop conditions)
- Evidence register (what evidence, quality notes)
- Risk + reversibility note (rollback plan)
- Governance review note (challenge/confirm/reverse)

## Decision Escalation During Pilots
Escalation is the act of moving a decision across a threshold, not a reward for
activity. Lower-reversibility decisions require higher evidence sufficiency; if
evidence is weak, strategic deferral is a valid outcome. Escalation should
clarify which evidence is sufficient, which is insufficient, and what would
trigger reassessment.

## Common Misuse Signals
Misuse signals suggest governance is bypassed or reduced to theater:

- Output or enthusiasm substituted for evidence.
- Iteration continues despite unresolved thresholds.
- Governance bypassed "for speed."
- A pilot becomes a de facto product without a threshold decision.
- Escalation avoided due to sunk cost or internal politics.
- "Pilot as theater" (activity without falsifiable learning).
- Success criteria rewritten after results are known.
- Scope creep introduced to avoid disconfirming evidence.
- "Pilot" used to bypass decision rights or governance review.
- Cherry-picked evidence with negative results left unreported.

## Diagram Audit Note
No diagram is included in Pass 1. Any future diagram must:

- show non-linearity and regression/rollback paths
- make threshold crossings explicit
- depict escalation in relation to reversibility and optionality
- emphasize decisions over phases
- avoid funnels, pipelines, or maturity ladders
