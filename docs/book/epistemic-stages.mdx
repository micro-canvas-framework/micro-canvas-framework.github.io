This page explains the canonical epistemic stage concepts without prescribing
workflows, phase gates, or delivery sequences.

:::note Purpose
Clarify how MCF 2.2 stages represent **states of epistemic resolution**, not
mandatory process steps or linear progression.

:::info What this explains
- How epistemic stages differ from workflow phases.
- What it means to progress, pause, or regress.
- How evidence quality changes stage readiness.
- How parallel activity can occur across stages.

## Epistemic stages (explanatory)
In MCF 2.2, an epistemic stage is a statement about what is **known well enough**
to justify a decision under defined constraints. It does not describe *how*
teams work, which activities they perform, or in what order tasks must occur.
Activities may run in parallel, but the decision state only changes when
evidence meets the threshold defined in Canon (Kelly, 2006).

Stages are therefore **reversible**. New evidence can weaken or invalidate a
claim, requiring a decision to move backward. This prevents false certainty
and protects teams from scaling or committing resources on unsupported
assumptions (Steup, 2005).

Evidence may also **decay** over time as context changes. When prior evidence
no longer supports the decision threshold, revalidation is required before
maintaining or advancing the stage.

## Stage progression signals
Progression requires evidence that:
- addresses the specific assumption or claim under evaluation
- is strong enough to change the decision state
- remains valid within Canon-defined constraints

If evidence is ambiguous or conflicting, the stage should **pause**. If
evidence invalidates the current claim, the stage should **regress**. Progress
without meeting an explicit threshold constitutes epistemic drift.

## Epistemic stages overview (MCF 2.2)

**Figure X. Epistemic stages as decision states in MCF 2.2.**  
This figure illustrates epistemic stages as reversible states governed by
evidence thresholds, not as linear workflow steps. Evidence quality determines
progression, pause, or regression between states.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret stage language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal definitions or constraints.
- Treat stages as epistemic states, not workflow steps.
