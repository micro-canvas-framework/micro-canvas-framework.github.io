This page explains the canonical stage concepts without prescribing workflows
or phase gates.

:::note Purpose
Clarify how MCF 2.2 stages represent **states of epistemic resolution**, not
mandatory process steps.
:::

:::info What this explains
- How stages differ from workflow phases.
- What it means to progress, pause, or regress.
- How evidence quality changes stage readiness.
- How parallel activity can occur across stages.

## Epistemic stages (explanatory)
In MCF 2.2, a stage is a statement about what is **known well enough** to
support a decision. It does not describe *how* you work or in what order tasks
must occur. Teams can run activities in parallel, but the decision state only
changes when evidence meets the threshold defined in Canon.

Stages are therefore **reversible**. New evidence can reduce confidence and
move a decision backward. This prevents false certainty and protects teams from
scaling on weak assumptions.

## Stage progression signals
Progression requires evidence that:
- addresses the specific assumption in question
- is strong enough to change the decision state
- remains valid under the constraints defined in Canon

If evidence is conflicting or low quality, the stage should **pause**. If
evidence invalidates the current assumption, the stage should **regress**.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret stage language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal definitions or rules.
- Treat stages as epistemic states, not workflow steps.
