This page explains scope boundaries and misuse constraints derived from the
Canon.

:::note Purpose
Clarify what MCF 2.2 is *not*, so the framework is not misrepresented or
overextended.
:::

:::info What this explains
- The boundary between Canon and derivative materials.
- Common misuse patterns and why they matter.
- Why guarantees, certifications, or scorecards are non-canonical.
- How to avoid over-claiming impact or validity.
:::

## Boundaries (explanatory)
MCF 2.2 is an **epistemic framework**. It defines evidence-first decision
constraints, not delivery workflows. It cannot be represented as a guarantee of
innovation success, a certification standard, or a mandatory process model.

Misuse often starts with well-intentioned extensions that exceed the Canon. The
Book layer exists to explain, not to override. When interpretation drifts into
new rules or promises, it crosses the boundary.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret boundary language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal boundaries and constraints.
- Treat boundary enforcement as a governance requirement.
