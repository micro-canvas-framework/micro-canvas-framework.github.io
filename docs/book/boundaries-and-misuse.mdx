Clarify what MCF 2.2 is *not*, so the framework is not misrepresented or
overextended.

- The boundary between Canon and derivative materials.
- Common misuse patterns and why they matter.
- Why guarantees, certifications, or scorecards are non-canonical.
- How to avoid over-claiming impact or validity.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret boundary language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal boundaries and constraints.
- Treat boundary enforcement as a governance requirement.

## Boundaries in MCF 2.2
Boundaries define the limits of what the MicroCanvas Framework claims, governs,
and legitimizes. They protect the epistemic integrity of the framework by
preventing overreach, misrepresentation, and false certainty.

MCF 2.2 is an epistemic framework, not a delivery methodology, certification
scheme, or performance guarantee.

## Canon vs. Derivative Layers
The Canon defines:

- epistemic stages
- evidence thresholds
- decision logic
- governance constraints

The Book layer explains and interprets the Canon. It does not add new rules,
metrics, or guarantees. When derivative material introduces new claims, it must
be clearly labeled as non-canonical.

## Common Misuse Patterns
Misuse often emerges through:

- presenting MCF as a step-by-step process
- implying guaranteed outcomes or success rates
- turning stages into maturity scores or checklists
- branding interpretations as “official Canon”

These patterns matter because they replace epistemic discipline with narrative
confidence.

## Why Guarantees and Certifications Are Excluded
Guarantees, certifications, and scorecards imply stable causality and repeatable
outcomes. Innovation work is inherently uncertain and context-dependent.

MCF 2.2 explicitly rejects claims that:

- following the framework ensures success
- stages can be “passed” permanently
- organizations can be certified as compliant

Such claims violate the evidence-first premise of the framework.

## Boundary Enforcement as Governance
Boundaries are not optional guidance; they are governance constraints.
When boundaries are crossed:

- evidence thresholds are weakened
- accountability becomes unclear
- trust in the framework degrades

Enforcing boundaries is therefore part of protecting decision integrity, not
limiting creativity.

## Using Boundaries Defensively
Boundaries should be used to:

- challenge over-claims in presentations or reports
- prevent premature scaling or validation language
- clarify what conclusions cannot yet be drawn

A useful boundary test is:
“Would this claim still be defensible if evidence weakens or reverses?”
