This page explains how decision thresholds and reversibility operate in MCF 2.2
without prescribing workflows, phase gates, or timelines.

:::note Purpose
Explain how decisions **advance**, **pause**, or **reverse** based on evidence
quality, risk, and reversibility.

:::info What this explains
- What decision thresholds are and how they are used.
- Why reversibility matters before committing resources.
- How to interpret evidence sufficiency in context.
- How decision integrity prevents premature scaling.

## Decision thresholds (explanatory)
In MCF 2.2, a decision threshold is the **minimum evidentiary standard required
to defend a decision** under explicit constraints. Thresholds are not universal.
They vary based on risk exposure, cost of error, and reversibility (Kahneman,
2011).

A decision should not advance because activity occurred, consensus emerged, or
time elapsed. It advances only when evidence reduces uncertainty enough to make
the decision defensible. The Canon defines threshold logic; the Book layer
explains how to interpret sufficiency without turning thresholds into checklists.

## Reversibility, cost of error, and optionality
Reversibility determines how costly it is to be wrong. When a decision is
highly reversible, the threshold may be lower because corrective action is
possible at limited cost. When a decision is irreversible, thresholds must be
higher because error propagates systemically (Taleb, 2012).

MCF 2.2 emphasizes **optionality preservation**: maintaining multiple viable
paths until evidence justifies commitment. Optionality is not indecision; it is
a deliberate strategy to delay irreversible choices until uncertainty is
sufficiently reduced.

## Decision logic overview (MCF 2.2)

:::info Figure placeholder
**Figure X. Decision thresholds as a function of reversibility and risk.**  
This figure illustrates how evidence thresholds increase as reversibility
decreases and systemic risk rises, independent of time or delivery cadence.

:::tip How to use this page
- Use it to interpret decision language in Book chapters.
- Use Canon pages when you need formal definitions or constraints.
- Treat thresholds as evidence gates, not timelines.
