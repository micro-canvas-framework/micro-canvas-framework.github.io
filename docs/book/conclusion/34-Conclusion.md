MCF 2.2 is not a checklist. It is a decision system grounded in evidence. The
five phases describe how uncertainty is reduced and how commitments become
defensible over time. This conclusion closes the narrative arc by reaffirming
the epistemic nature of the framework and the boundary between Canon and Book.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is where continuity must outlast the initial program. The Book layer
explains how the phases relate; the Canon defines what counts as valid. If that
boundary blurs, the framework becomes a narrative rather than a decision
system. The conclusion therefore reinforces that MCF is epistemic, not
procedural, and that Canon remains the authoritative source.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
The journey is coherent when the following are true:

- Evidence is consistently tied to decision thresholds.
- Governance protects integrity as scope and scale expand.
- Execution remains reversible until evidence justifies commitment.
- Learning prevents regression to intuition-only decisions.

These are not outcomes to claim; they are properties of a defensible decision
system.

## Typical Failure Modes
Common misreadings undermine the framework:

- **Framework ≠ guarantee:** outcomes are not promised by structure alone.
- **Maturity ≠ linear progress:** the path includes reversals and deferrals.
- **Tools ≠ rules:** artifacts do not replace Canon constraints.
- **Book ≠ Canon:** explanatory text does not define norms.

When these misreadings appear, revisit Canon boundaries and governance rules.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that the framework is functioning at maturity includes:

- Decisions that are reversible until thresholds are met.
- Traceable rationale for scale commitments and governance approvals.
- Explicit use of boundary constraints when new tools or programs are proposed.
- Evidence that learning updates assumptions rather than preserving narrative.

If these signals are absent, the system is drifting from evidence-first
decision integrity.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Misuse often shows up as narrative drift:

- Treating the Book as a ruleset rather than an interpretation layer.
- Using tools to assert compliance without evidence.
- Claiming maturity progression as linear or guaranteed.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to reassert the interpretive boundary.
Canon defines what is valid; the Book explains how to read and apply it.
