:::warning What this chapter does not do
- Does not introduce new rules.
- Does not replace Canon definitions.
- Does not provide operational steps.

:::info Derived from Canon
This chapter is interpretive and explanatory. Its constraints and limits derive from the Canon pages below.

- [Canon - Definitions](/docs/canon/definitions)
- [Canon - Evidence logic](/docs/canon/evidence-logic)
- [Canon - Decision theory](/docs/canon/decision-theory)
- [Canon - Epistemic stage model](/docs/canon/epistemic-model)
:::

:::info Key terms (canonical)
- Evidence
- Evidence quality
- Decision threshold
- Optionality preservation
- Strategic deferral
- Reversibility
:::

:::note Minimal evidence expectations (non-prescriptive)
Evidence used in this chapter should allow you to:
- summarize outcomes and gaps
- show evidence of transformation
- explain ongoing commitments
- justify future priorities

MCF 2.2 is not a checklist. It is a decision system grounded in evidence. The
five phases describe how uncertainty is reduced and how commitments become
defensible over time. This conclusion summarizes the journey and clarifies how
to continue once the book ends.

## 1. What the journey establishes
Across the phases, you build:
- a shared definition of innovation maturity
- evidence-first decision logic
- governance that protects integrity
- operational reliability that supports scale
- adaptive learning that sustains outcomes

These are not endpoints. They are capabilities that must be maintained.

## 2. Continuing beyond the book
The Book layer explains and interprets. The Canon defines rules and boundaries.
If new programs or tools are developed, they must map back to Canon to avoid
drift. Use the decision thresholds and evidence expectations as ongoing checks.

## 3. Final reminder
Innovation without evidence is narrative. Evidence without governance is
fragile. Governance without learning is temporary. MCF 2.2 treats these as a
system. Keep the system intact, and the outcomes will follow.
