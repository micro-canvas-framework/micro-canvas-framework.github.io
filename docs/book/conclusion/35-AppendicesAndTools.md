Appendices and tools are supporting artifacts, not sources of authority. This
chapter explains how to use tools without turning them into substitutes for
evidence or Canon.

## 1. Tools as supports, not rules
Tools help structure work, but they are not canonical. If a tool conflicts with
Canon boundaries or definitions, the Canon wins. Treat tools as aids to improve
clarity and consistency.

## 2. When tools are useful
Tools are useful when they:
- reduce ambiguity in decision inputs
- make evidence collection repeatable
- help teams communicate assumptions and outcomes

If a tool cannot change a decision, it is optional.

## 3. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when selecting or designing templates, checklists, or
artifacts. It is not a tool catalog. It is a lens for deciding whether a tool
supports evidence integrity.
