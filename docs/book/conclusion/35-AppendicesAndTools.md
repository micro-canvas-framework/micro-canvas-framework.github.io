Appendices and tools are supporting artifacts, not sources of authority. This
chapter explains how to use tools without turning them into substitutes for
evidence or Canon.

## Why This Matters In Phase 5
Phase 5 is where tools often become institutionalized. That creates risk: tools
can be mistaken for rules, and examples can be mistaken for obligations. The
framework depends on preserving the boundary between Canon (normative) and
Book (explanatory). Tools are optional accelerators, not compliance guarantees.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Tools are used responsibly when:

- Their purpose and scope are explicit and evidence-aligned.
- They clarify decision inputs rather than prescribe outcomes.
- They remain replaceable without changing Canon semantics.
- They are governed by the same boundaries and auditability rules.

Good tooling reduces ambiguity without creating new rules.

## Typical Failure Modes
Tooling failures often come from boundary drift:

- **Tool elevation:** templates treated as Canon rules.
- **Checklist compliance:** evidence reduced to box-ticking.
- **False certification:** tools interpreted as proof of maturity or readiness.
- **Scope creep:** examples used as mandatory processes.

These failures undermine decision integrity and misrepresent the framework.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that tools are being used correctly includes:

- Clear mapping between tool outputs and decision thresholds.
- Traceable decisions that cite evidence, not template completion.
- Explicit statements that tools are optional and replaceable.
- Governance review when tools influence irreversible commitments.

If tools cannot change decisions, they should not be treated as evidence.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Boundary violations are most visible in tool claims:

- Presenting tools as certification or compliance mechanisms.
- Using tool completion as a substitute for evidence.
- Treating diagrams as Canon without citation or governance.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` to keep tools within the Book layer.
Canon definitions and boundaries remain authoritative.
