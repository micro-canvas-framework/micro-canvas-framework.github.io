Quality control and risk management protect decision integrity when execution
scales. In Phase 3, the goal is not to eliminate risk, but to make it visible,
owned, and governed. This chapter explains how to interpret quality and risk
signals without turning them into rigid compliance steps.

## Why This Matters In Phase 3
Phase 3 is where execution risk becomes structural. The organization is no
longer testing isolated pilots; it is building repeatable delivery. If quality
is unstable or risks are unowned, the evidence used to justify scaling is
invalid. Quality control and risk management are therefore epistemic
requirements, not administrative add-ons.

For example, a manufacturing line may add a secondary verification step after a
new supplier change. The step is justified only if it reduces uncertainty about
defect rates and preserves reversibility when the supplier performance changes.

These practices also protect reversibility. The more you scale, the harder it
is to unwind a decision. Risk controls help identify when optionality is being
lost and when termination logic should be considered.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
Good quality and risk practices are aligned with decision thresholds:

- Quality checks are tied to decisions, not to habit.
- Risks are defined as conditions that would invalidate a decision.
- Controls are proportional to potential irreversible harm.
- Evidence is traceable to responsible owners and decisions.

The aim is to maintain decision integrity, not to maximize compliance
documentation. Quality is meaningful only when it changes how decisions are
made.

Clarification: risk management is not a universal gate. It is evidence about
which decisions remain reversible and which should be deferred, not a blanket
permission to proceed or stop.

## Typical Failure Modes
Common patterns indicate that quality and risk evidence is insufficient:

- **Hidden variance:** quality appears stable until scale exposes defects.
- **Late detection:** failures surface after irreversible commitments.
- **Unowned exposure:** no clear decision owner for risk monitoring.
- **Compliance drift:** controls are bypassed under delivery pressure.

Misuse signal: controls exist, but nobody can explain which decision they
protect or what threshold would trigger a pause.

These are signals to pause and reassess. Use `/docs/book/failure-modes` to
categorize whether the issue is epistemic, executional, or governance related.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence that quality and risk are under control should include:

- Stable outcomes over multiple cycles, not one-off successes.
- Documented thresholds for acceptable defect rates or exposure.
- Traceable escalation paths when thresholds are breached.
- Evidence that controls reduce uncertainty, not just add process steps.

If a control does not reduce uncertainty or protect reversibility, it is
overhead rather than evidence.
Evidence sufficiency is contextual: as optionality decreases, the same defect
rate may no longer be adequate proof of readiness.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Quality and risk management can be misused when they become detached from
decision relevance:

- Treating compliance artifacts as proof of decision readiness.
- Using controls to block change rather than to clarify evidence.
- Defining risk in ways that cannot be tested or observed.

Quality is not a linear progression. It may improve, regress, and stabilize
again as scope changes, evidence degrades, or governance evolves.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` as the interpretive boundary. Canon
defines what counts as defensible change, not local policy.
