Quality control and risk management protect decision integrity when execution
scales. In Phase 3, the goal is not to eliminate risk, but to make it visible,
owned, and governed. This chapter explains how to interpret quality and risk
signals without turning them into rigid compliance steps.

## 1. Quality as evidence
Quality control provides evidence that a process is producing reliable
outcomes. If quality is unstable, evidence from later phases is unreliable.
Consistency is therefore a prerequisite for scaling.

Quality signals may include defect rates, rework cycles, or customer impact
metrics. The key is not the specific measure, but whether it changes the
decision state.

## 2. Risk management as decision protection
Risk management identifies where a decision could cause irreversible harm or
reputational loss. Evidence-first risk management asks:
- what failure would invalidate the decision?
- what evidence would show we are exposed?
- what mitigations reduce uncertainty?

## 3. Common failure patterns (explanatory)
- **Hidden variance:** quality looks stable until scale reveals defects.
- **Unowned risk:** no clear owner for monitoring or response.
- **Late detection:** problems appear after irreversible commitments.
- **Compliance drift:** governance is bypassed under pressure.

These patterns are signals to pause or revise decisions.

## 4. Interpreting control proposals
Controls should be justified by decision risk, not by habit. A control that
does not reduce uncertainty or protect reversibility is overhead. A control that
clearly reduces exposure is an evidence investment.

## 5. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when outcomes must be reliable under scale, or when regulatory
exposure increases. It is not legal advice. It is a decision lens for when
quality and risk controls are required.
