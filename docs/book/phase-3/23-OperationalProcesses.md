Operational processes are the repeatable pathways that turn decisions into
consistent outcomes. In Phase 3, the focus is not speed alone, but reliability:
can the organization deliver the same result with predictable quality when
conditions change? This chapter explains how to interpret operational design
through the evidence-first lens and how to recognize when process changes are
justified.

## Why This Matters In Phase 3
Phase 3 is where uncertainty shifts from discovery to execution. The decision
question changes from "Should we pursue this?" to "Can we deliver it
consistently?" Operational processes are the mechanism that makes evidence
repeatable. Without repeatability, evidence is noisy and cannot support
threshold-based decisions.

Operational design matters because it creates stable decision contexts. If the
same inputs produce different outputs, you cannot determine whether the product
or the process is responsible. Streamlining is not about optimizing for speed;
it is about lowering variance so evidence can be trusted. This is the
foundation for scale and for later governance review.

A concrete example: a services team standardizes intake and handoff for a
repeatable experiment type. The change does not "prove success," but it
reduces variance in cycle time and clarifies whether evidence thresholds are
being met. That makes reversibility credible when signals degrade.

## What “Good” Looks Like (Explanatory)
"Good" operations in MCF 2.2 are not defined by a specific methodology. They
are defined by properties that preserve decision integrity:

- Clear handoffs: owners and decision rights are explicit.
- Repeatable steps: the same work yields comparable outcomes.
- Evidenced outcomes: results are captured with traceable evidence.
- Adaptable flow: the process can change when evidence invalidates assumptions.

Good operations reduce ambiguity without creating rigidity. They enable
learning by making cause-and-effect relationships visible. This is especially
important when the organization is balancing optionality preservation and
progress in parallel.

Clarification: repeatability is not uniformity. A process can be repeatable and
still allow non-linear adjustments when evidence shifts. The goal is to preserve
optionality while keeping evidence sufficient and comparable across cycles.

## Typical Failure Modes
Operational failure modes often show up as evidence quality problems rather
than obvious delivery breakdowns. Common patterns include:

- Hidden rework that distorts delivery timelines and masks true effort.
- Unowned dependencies that delay decisions without accountability.
- Tooling mismatches that produce inconsistent outputs across teams.
- Process exceptions that are never reconciled back into the canonical flow.

These are not moral failures; they are signals that operational evidence is
insufficient or misleading. When they appear, use the Failure Modes framing in
`/docs/book/failure-modes` to diagnose whether the issue is epistemic,
executional, or governance-related.

Misuse signal: teams celebrate shorter cycle times while evidence quality
declines. That pattern often indicates hidden rework or missing decision
checkpoints rather than true reliability.

## Evidence You Should Expect To See
Evidence for operational process readiness should be concrete and decision
relevant. Examples include:

- Stable cycle times across comparable work units.
- Reduced variance after a process change (not just average improvement).
- Documented decision checkpoints with traceable inputs and outcomes.
- Observable reductions in rework, handoff friction, or escalations.

These signals help determine whether the process is ready to scale or whether
additional iteration is required. The evidence should align with the decision
thresholds defined in Canon.

Evidence sufficiency matters more than volume. A small, auditable set of
signals that can change a decision is stronger than a large set of metrics that
cannot. This keeps reversibility intact when assumptions must be revisited.

## Common Misuse And Boundary Notes
Operational optimization can be misused when it becomes detached from evidence
and decision integrity. Typical boundary violations include:

- Treating process efficiency as a substitute for evidential adequacy.
- Locking processes prematurely and reducing reversibility.
- Using operational metrics as success claims without supporting evidence.

Use `/docs/book/boundaries-and-misuse` as the interpretive boundary check. The
goal is to preserve optionality and auditability while improving reliability.

Non-linearity is expected: processes may regress to earlier designs when new
evidence invalidates a change. This is not failure; it is the mechanism that
protects decision integrity.
