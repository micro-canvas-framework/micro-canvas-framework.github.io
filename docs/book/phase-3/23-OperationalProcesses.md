Operational processes are the repeatable pathways that turn decisions into
consistent outcomes. In Phase 3, the focus is not on speed alone, but on
reliability: can the organization deliver the same result with predictable
quality when conditions change? This chapter explains how to interpret
operational design through the evidence-first lens and how to recognize when
process changes are justified.

## 1. Why operational process design matters
Innovation initiatives often fail during handoff from discovery to delivery.
The reason is not the idea itself, but the operational path that executes it.
Process design provides the infrastructure for repeatability, and repeatability
is what makes evidence meaningful at scale.

When processes are inconsistent, the evidence you collect becomes noisy. You
cannot tell whether outcomes are caused by the innovation or by variability in
execution. Streamlining reduces that noise and clarifies decision signals.

## 2. Process clarity vs process rigidity
MCF 2.2 does not require heavy process. It requires clear decision points,
ownership, and evidence checkpoints. The goal is to reduce ambiguity, not to
create bureaucracy.

Explanatory framing:
- Clarity means roles, inputs, and outputs are explicit.
- Rigidity means the process cannot adapt to new evidence.
- Evidence-first operations are clear but flexible.

## 3. Evidence signals in operations
Operational processes should produce signals that support decisions:
- consistency of outputs across cycles
- repeatability of key steps without rework
- predictable variance within known limits

These signals help determine whether a process is ready to scale or whether it
requires revision.

## 4. Typical bottlenecks (explanatory)
Common bottlenecks are not failures; they are evidence of process gaps:
- unclear handoffs between teams or functions
- dependencies that are not tracked or owned
- tooling that produces inconsistent results
- undocumented assumptions about timing or capacity

The goal is to identify which bottlenecks change decision confidence and which
are tolerable in the current stage.

## 5. Interpreting change proposals
Process changes should be treated as hypotheses. Before changing a process,
define the expected outcome and the evidence that would confirm or refute it.
This keeps improvements aligned with decision thresholds instead of preference.

## 6. Applying this chapter
Use this chapter when a delivery path blocks progress or when scale depends on
repeatability. It is not a prescription for operations teams. It is a lens for
deciding when operational work is required and what evidence should result.
