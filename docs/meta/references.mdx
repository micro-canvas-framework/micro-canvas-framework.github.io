### Purpose

- References support epistemic defensibility; they do not transfer authority.
- Canon is normative; sources contextualize and justify constraints.

### Citation policy

- Use Harvard style consistently.
- Prefer primary sources: standards, laws, peer-reviewed research, official institutional documents.
- Every major canonical construct must have >=1 valid source.
- No secondary blogs as primary justification.
